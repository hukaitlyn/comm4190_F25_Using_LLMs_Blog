    "## **Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing up in Taipei spoiled me in the best way. Everything was easy. Food at every hour. Public transit that actually works. Streets that feel alive but never overwhelming. When I moved to Philadelphia for college, it honestly felt like learning how to live all over again. Suddenly I had to think about safety, transportation, groceries, weather, everything. I didn’t realize how much a city shapes your daily life until I had to start rebuilding those routines from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I’m in my early twenties and about to graduate, I keep wondering what comes next. Where am I supposed to go after this? What city actually makes sense for the kind of adult life I want? I still don’t fully know what that looks like, but I do know that choosing where to live feels like choosing a version of myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for fun, and maybe also out of mild panic, I decided to ask an LLM to rank cities around the world for someone in their early twenties trying to figure things out. I wanted to see what it would pick based on things like affordability, community, nightlife, culture, and general vibes. Not because AI has all the answers, but because I’m curious whether it can help me think about this in a new way. Maybe it’ll give me ideas. Maybe it’ll tell me something I already knew. Either way, it feels like a pretty entertaining experiment while I try to sort out my next steps."

    "\n",
    "> I’m in my early twenties, about to graduate, and trying to figure out where I should live next. I grew up in Taipei and currently study in Philadelphia, so I’m used to cities with very different lifestyles. Can you rank around 10 cities around the world that would be great for someone in my stage of life?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Consider things like affordability, job opportunities, social life, walkability, public transportation, general safety, community feel, dating and friendships, culture, food, and overall quality of life for young people.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For each city, give a short explanation of why it might be a good fit.\n",
    "Also tell me which cities might match someone who grew up in Taipei, and which feel closer to Philadelphia.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you need more details about what I want or my personality, ask me first."

    "## **Reflection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading the AI’s ranking was actually pretty fun. It did a good job breaking down each city in terms of things that matter in your early twenties, like community, food, job opportunities, and what the overall vibe feels like. I also liked how it compared cities that would feel familiar to someone from Taipei versus someone who has lived in Philadelphia. That part felt surprisingly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I didn’t love was how casually it treated affordability. Some of the cities on the list are objectively expensive, and the AI sometimes glosses over that reality. I also wish it had offered a few more unexpected choices instead of sticking mostly to well-known global hubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the list helped me realize what I actually care about in a city: safety, good public transportation, a strong food culture, and a sense of community. It also made me think about how much a city influences the version of myself I become. Even though AI can’t tell me exactly where to go after graduation, it did help me organize my thoughts and see the decision in a new way."
