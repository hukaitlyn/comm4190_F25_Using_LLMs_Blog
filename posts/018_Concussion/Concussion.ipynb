    "\n",
    "This fall, I took the train to NYC to help my friend after she got a concussion. I wasn’t panicking, but I also wasn’t completely sure what “concussion care” actually looks like outside of a lecture slide. I’ve sat through enough neuroscience classes to know the basics, but applying that in a real moment felt different.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I opened an LLM and asked it how to take care of her in the simplest, most practical way. I wanted to see whether an AI model could be grounding and helpful when someone I cared about needed me to show up, not academically but personally."

    "## **Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> You're doing a great thing by taking care of your friend. Concussions are brain injuries, and the first 24–48 hours are important for monitoring symptoms and giving the brain time to begin healing. Here’s a clear, simple guide to help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🟢 What You Should Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Let Her Rest  \n",
    ">   - Encourage physical and mental rest. No physical activity, no schoolwork, no video games, or texting.\n",
    ">   - Keep things quiet and calm.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">2. Monitor Her Closely  \n",
    ">   - Stay nearby so you can check in regularly. You don’t need to wake her up constantly if she’s sleeping unless her doctor said to.\n",
    ">   - Check her every few hours: Can she speak clearly? Does she know where she is? Does she respond normally?\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3. Offer Light, Easy Foods  \n",
    ">   - Only if she feels okay to eat. Avoid anything too heavy if she feels nauseated.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. Help Limit Screens  \n",
    ">   - Keep TV, phones, tablets, and computers off or to an absolute minimum. They can make symptoms worse.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">5. Help Her Stay Hydrated  \n",
    ">   - Offer small amounts of water regularly.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">6. Keep Notes  \n",
    ">   - Write down any symptoms you notice and if they change or worsen. This helps if you need to talk to a doctor.\n",
    "\n",
    ">🛑 What to Avoid:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- No physical activity or sports\n",
    ">- No driving, biking, or operating anything\n",
    ">- No alcohol or medications (unless prescribed for the concussion)\n",
    ">- No loud music, bright lights, or screen time\n",
    ">- No tough mental tasks (homework, intense conversations, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    ">🚨 Warning Signs — Call a Doctor or 911 If You Notice:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Repeated vomiting\n",
    ">- Loss of consciousness (even briefly)\n",
    ">- Increasing confusion, agitation, or unusual behavior\n",
    ">- Slurred speech, weakness, or numbness\n",
    ">- Seizure activity (shaking, convulsing)\n",
    ">- One pupil larger than the other or uneven eye movement\n",
    ">- Trouble walking or staying awake\n",
    "\n",
    ">💛 How to Support Her Physically and Emotionally:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Be patient and reassuring. She might feel frustrated, slow, or tired — that’s normal.\n",
    ">- Keep the environment calm. Dim lights, low noise, low stress.\n",
    ">- Let her know it’s okay not to “bounce back” right away — recovery takes time.\n",
    ">- Check in without overwhelming her — offer help but keep conversation simple.\n",
    ">- Let her nap as needed—sleep helps the brain heal.\n",
    "\n",
    ">👍 Most Important in the First 24–48 Hours:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Keep her rested and in a calm, safe place\n",
    ">- Monitor for any worsening symptoms\n",
    ">- Avoid anything that could overstimulate or risk another injury\n",
    ">- Be ready to call for help if serious symptoms appear\n",
    "\n",
    ">You’ve got this. Your support and watchfulness make a big difference in her recovery. If you’re uncertain about anything, don’t hesitate to call a doctor.\n"

    "The LLM’s response ended up being more useful than I expected. When you’re taking care of someone with a concussion, it’s surprisingly easy to second-guess even the basics, and having the information laid out so clearly made everything feel less chaotic. It reminded me of simple but important things like keeping the room quiet, letting her rest without guilt, and watching for small changes in her mood or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing it said was groundbreaking, but in the moment, it helped me feel more grounded and confident that I was doing the right things. It didn’t replace my judgment, but it definitely made the whole situation feel more manageable."
