    "## **Introduction** \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In my first post, I asked an LLM to design a two-week training plan for my touch rugby camp. The plan was well structured and covered everything from conditioning to ball-handling, but it was also built without any real understanding of who I am as an athlete. It didn’t ask about my schedule, my position, my strengths and weaknesses, or whether I had any injuries. A real coach wouldn’t design a program without asking those things first.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this follow-up post, I wanted to see whether I could make the AI behave more like an actual coach by changing the prompt. I used a more structured approach based on prompting techniques that focus on giving the AI a defined role, a clear process, and the instruction to ask questions before producing anything. This mirrors the way coaches gather information before building a training plan.\n"

    "### How I Rewrote the Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "To redesign the prompt, I followed ideas that come from prompt experts like Ethan Mollick and from general research on structured prompting. Instead of asking the AI for a plan directly, I broke the request into clear phases that a real coach would follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I gave the model a defined role by telling it to act as a high-performance touch rugby coach. This helps the AI adjust its tone, structure, and level of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I required a one-question-at-a-time intake process. This forces the AI to personalize the plan and prevents it from skipping to generic answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, I told it which specific categories it needed to ask about, including conditioning, sprint speed, ball-handling ability, injury history, available training time, and equipment access. Without this step, AI tends to guess or assume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, I asked it to summarize its understanding of me before creating the plan. This clarifies how well it interpreted my answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I required the training plan to directly reflect my responses. This prevents the AI from giving me a random template and makes it build something that actually fits my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring the prompt this way, I was essentially teaching the AI to behave less like a search engine and more like an actual coach who listens first and designs second. The next section shows the exact prompt I used."

    "Second, summarize your understanding of me as an athlete.\n",
    "Third, create a fully personalized two-week training plan that directly reflects my answers. The plan should include conditioning, agility, sprint work, ball-handling, strength and stability, recovery practices, nutrition, hydration, and mental preparation for decision-making and game awareness.\n",

    "## **Reflection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing this plan to the one from my first post, the main difference is how specific it is. The earlier plan covered everything a typical touch rugby program would include, but it was clearly built without much understanding of me as an athlete. It did not account for my position, my conditioning level, or my injury history. It worked as a general outline, but not something I would realistically follow as a full training schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the new prompt, the AI took the time to ask questions first, and that made the final plan feel more relevant. The conditioning matches where I am right now. The stability work makes sense for my ACL and ankle history. The skill work reflects what I want to improve. The weekly structure also fits the amount of time I can actually train.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still parts that feel overstructured, and it is not the same as working with a real coach who adjusts things based on how I feel that day. Even so, this version is more useful and more realistic. The improvement came from giving clearer instructions and requiring the AI to gather information before creating anything. If I use AI again for training ideas, this is the approach I would use."
