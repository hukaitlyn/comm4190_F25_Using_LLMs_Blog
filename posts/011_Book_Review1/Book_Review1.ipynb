    "I just started A Brief History of Intelligence by Max Bennett, and the opening chapters set a thoughtful foundation for the rest of the book. Bennett begins by outlining the scope of his project, which is to explain how intelligence emerged across species and how those biological developments relate to modern artificial intelligence. His tone is clear and deliberate, and he writes in a way that feels accessible without oversimplifying the science. It is obvious he intends this book to bridge ideas from neuroscience, evolution, and computational modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The early chapters focus on the large question of what intelligence actually is, and why understanding its origins matters. Bennett frames intelligence as a layered, cumulative process that evolved over millions of years rather than something that appeared suddenly. I appreciated how he situates humans not as a separate category, but as part of a long continuum of life that gradually developed increasingly complex cognitive abilities. This perspective feels grounding and aligns well with what I have learned in my neuroscience coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that stood out is the way Bennett positions artificial intelligence within this evolutionary context. He hints that AI systems do not emerge from biological pressures, yet they borrow patterns from evolution, such as incremental refinement, feedback loops, and the accumulation of complexity. Even in these early chapters, he draws subtle parallels between biological intelligence and modern machine learning architectures. It made me think more carefully about the boundaries between natural and artificial forms of intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opening chapters were surprisingly easy to follow, and they left me interested in where Bennett is going next. I’m curious to see how he expands these early ideas and how he connects the biological story of intelligence with the rapid changes happening in AI. It already feels like a book that will make me rethink how I understand intelligence as a whole."
