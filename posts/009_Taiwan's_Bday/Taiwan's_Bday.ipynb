    "Every year on 10/10, Taiwan celebrates its National Day. When I lived at home, the day always felt familiar in a quiet way. There were flags on buildings, red and blue decorations, and small traditions happening throughout the city. Living abroad changes that rhythm. The day blends into regular school life, and it becomes easy for it to pass without feeling like a holiday.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, I wanted to purposely make a little space for it. Even though I am far from Taiwan, there are still small things that make the day feel different, whether it is food, music, or simply taking a moment to think about home. I was also curious to see if an LLM could help me brainstorm new ways to celebrate. In my recent posts, I have used AI for training plans and event planning. This time, I wanted to try something lighter. I gave the model a small amount of information and asked for ideas that would help me celebrate 10/10 from campus."

    "> ### Celebrating Taiwan's National Day: A Simple Guide for Students Abroad\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Core Spirit:** Taiwan's National Day (Double Ten Day) is a day filled with red, white, and blue colors, and deep affection for this land and its people. While abroad, we can celebrate this special day through tastes, sights, sounds, and heartfelt connections.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ### I. Small Activities\n",
    ">\n",
    "> These activities are easy to do and can help you feel the festive atmosphere:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1.  **DIY National Day Color Decorations:**\n",
    ">     *   Use red, white, and blue paper to cut out simple decorations, like paper stars, small flags, or the plum blossom symbol of Taiwan.\n",
    ">     *   Use pens in these colors to write down your blessings or thoughts for Taiwan.\n",
    "> 2.  **Taiwanese Music Marathon:**\n",
    ">     *   Create a playlist of Taiwanese music – it could be Mandopop, Taiwanese Hokkien pop, indie bands, or traditional folk songs. Play it while studying, cooking, or relaxing.\n",
    ">     *   Recommended artists: Mayday, Jay Chou (many of his early works have Taiwanese elements), Accusefive, EggPlantEgg, No Party For Cao Dong.\n",
    "> 3.  **Learn a Taiwanese Hokkien or Mandarin Phrase:**\n",
    ">     *   Learn a simple greeting, like \"Jia ba bo?\" (Have you eaten?) or \"Do sia\" (Thank you).\n",
    ">     *   Try to use these phrases on the day to remind yourself of your connection to Taiwan.\n",
    "> 4.  **Virtual Tour of Taiwan:**\n",
    ">     *   Watch travel vlogs, scenic videos, or food介紹s of Taiwan on YouTube. Imagine yourself strolling through night markets, mountains, or by the sea.\n",
    ">     *   Browse Taiwan Tourism Bureau websites to plan a future \"homecoming trip.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ### II. Food Ideas\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Even abroad, you can recreate Taiwanese flavors with simple ingredients:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1.  **Bubble Tea (Boba Tea)!**\n",

    "> 3.  **Scallion Pancakes (Cong You Bing) or Dumplings (Jiaozi):**\n",

    "\n",

    "## **Reflection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading through the list, I realized how many of the suggestions connected back to small parts of home that I usually do not think about until I miss them. The foods the AI mentioned reminded me of the scents and sounds of convenience stores, night markets, and family dinners. Even simple ideas like scallion pancakes or instant noodles carried the feeling of being back in a familiar kitchen in Taiwan. The suggestions about music also made sense, since Taiwanese songs can bring back memories faster than anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "I liked that the list included quiet activities too. Looking through old photos or writing a short note to people at home felt like a simple way to create a moment that is personal. These small routines reminded me of what 10/10 usually feels like in Taiwan, even if I am celebrating it in a completely different environment now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tone of the AI was more dramatic than how I would normally describe the holiday, but the ideas themselves were practical and tied to real parts of Taiwanese life. They helped me turn 10/10 from something that could easily pass by into a day that felt a little closer to home."
