About this blog

Hello! I'm Kaitlyn, an undergrad at Penn studying Neuroscience and Psychology. Welcome to my little corner for learning and experimenting with large language models (LLMs) through a series of playful prompts, curious questions, and occasional deeper dives. Happy reading! Hope you enjoy the ride as much as I've enjoyed writing it <3
