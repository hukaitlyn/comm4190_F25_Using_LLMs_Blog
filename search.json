    "title": "Can AI Coach an Athlete? My Two-Week Touch Rugby Training Plan",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\n\n\n\nMy Touch Team!!\n\n\nTouch rugby is one of those sports most people in the United States have never heard of, but the rest of the world absolutely loves. It is especially big in Australia and New Zealand, where people grow up playing it the way kids here grow up playing basketball or soccer. The easiest way to describe it is that it is a version of rugby without tackling. Instead of getting taken to the ground, play stops with a simple touch. Think of it as tag with a ball, except everyone is sprinting, passing, stepping, and trying to outsmart each other at full speed. It looks simple until you try it, and then you realize how technical and exhausting it actually is.\nIn two weeks, I will be attending a three-day touch rugby training camp as part of my preparation for USA Nationals with the NYC team. The camp runs from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon and each day is packed with drills, attacking lines, defensive patterns, footwork, conditioning, sprint work, and constant ball handling. It will be the most intense stretch of touch rugby training I have done so far, and I want to make sure I am actually ready for it.\nTwo weeks is not a lot of time to prepare, and I did not want to show up to camp feeling unprepared. So instead of randomly picking workouts or hoping practices would be enough, I asked an LLM to help me create an actual training plan. I wanted something realistic that matched the speed, movement, and ball-handling demands of touch rugby. This post includes the prompt I used, the plan the AI created, and my first impressions before I try it out.\n\nPrompt:\n\nI have a three-day touch rugby camp in two weeks. Each day runs from eight in the morning to four in the afternoon with constant movement including drills, sprinting, defensive structures, attacking lines, gameplay, agility work, conditioning, footwork, and ball handling. Please design a training plan to help me get ready. Include a realistic two-week training schedule, specific conditioning workouts for agility, sprint speed, and endurance, strength preparation focused on core stability, lower-body strength, and injury prevention, daily recovery recommendations, nutrition and hydration guidance for long training days, and mental preparation strategies that support confidence, game awareness, and fast decision-making. Make the plan tailored to the demands of touch rugby specifically.\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nAbsolutely! Preparing effectively for a three-day touch rugby camp requires a smart, well-rounded two-week plan that targets the physical, mental, and tactical demands of the sport. Below, you’ll find a tailored 14-day approach focused on:\n\nTraining Schedule Overview\n\nDetailed Conditioning Workouts\n\nStrength & Stability Training\n\nRecovery & Mobility\n\nNutrition & Hydration\n\nMental Preparation & Tactical Awareness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🗓 Two-Week Touch Rugby Performance Plan\nWeekly Structure:\n\n\n\nDay\nTraining Focus\n\n\n\n\nMon\nSpeed + Lower Body Strength + Core\n\n\nTue\nAgility + Gameplay Scenarios + Mobility\n\n\nWed\nConditioning + Strength (Unilateral Focus)\n\n\nThu\nSpeed + Skills (Ball Handling) + Core\n\n\nFri\nActive Recovery + Film + Visualization\n\n\nSat\nGameplay Simulation + Interval Sprints\n\n\nSun\nRecovery (Sleep, Stretching, Hydration)\n\n\n\nRepeat the structure for Week 2, with volumes tapering slightly in the final 3–4 days leading into camp.\n\n\n\n\n\n🏃‍♂️ Specific Conditioning Workouts\n1. Speed Workouts (2x/week)\nFocus: Acceleration, fast-change direction for 5–15m bursts\nSession Example (35 min)\nWarm-up: Dynamic drills (A-skips, high knees, carioca)\nSprint technique (10m posture holds, bounding)\nSprint drills:\n- 4 x 10m sprints (90% effort)\n- 3 x 20m sprints\n- 3 sets of 5m Shuttle Sprints (cone to cone)\n- 5 x Flying 15m sprints (build for 15m, sprint through)\nRest: 60–90s between reps\n2. Agility & Reactivity (2x/week)\nFocus: Reactive lateral movement, deceleration & re-acceleration\nSession Example (30–40 min)\nLadder warm-up: quick feet, 2-ins, crossovers\nCone drills:\n- “Y” drill with reactive cue (partner points direction)\n- Mirror drill with partner (3 sets, 20s bursts)\n- 4-cone lateral shuffle-sprint-repeat (3 rounds)\nBall-integrated movement work (pass and go, chase & tag)\n3. Endurance & Game-Fit Conditioning (2x/week)\nFocus: High-intensity efforts with short rest—mimics gameplay Session Example:\nTouch Intervals:\n- 6 x 3min small-sided touch games (3v3 or 4v4)\n- 60s rest between\nOR do:\n- 6 x 300m shuttle sprints (50m intervals)\n- Rest 60–90s\nEnd with 2 laps of field jog + dynamic stretching\n\n\n\n\n\n🏋️‍♀️ Strength & Injury Prevention\nFocus on functional strength (bodyweight + resistance), core stability, unilateral lower-body power and joint stability.\nCore & Stability (3x/week)\nDeadbugs: 3x10\nSide plank with leg raise: 2x20 sec/side\nBird-dog with pause: 2x10\nPallof press: 3x8/side\nRussian twists: 2x15\nLower Body Strength (2x/week)\nBulgarian split squat (DB or BW): 3x8/leg\nLateral lunges: 3x6/side\nStep-ups with drive: 3x8/side\nGlute bridges: 3x15\nCalf raises: 3x20 (focus on foot control)\nInjury Prevention (daily mini-session, ~10 min)\nBanded side steps\nHeel walks/toe walks\nAnkle and knee mobility drills\nEccentric hamstring curls (Nordics or ball): 3x5\nHip flexor stretch and glute activation\n\n\n\n\n\n🧘 Recovery & Mobility (Daily)\n10–15 min mobility at night:\n- Hip openers, pigeon stretch, hamstring flossing, calf stretches 1x/wk foam rolling session\nIce bath (1–2x/wk after hard days)\nSleep: 8+ hours consistently\nNaps OK: 20–30 min post-training (not too close to bedtime) &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n🥗 Nutrition & Hydration\nPre-Camp Fueling Strategy (2 Weeks Out)\nCarbs: Complex carbs at each meal (sweet potatoes, oats, rice, fruit)\nProtein: 1.5–1.8g/kg of body weight\nFats: Include olive oil, avocado, nuts (don’t neglect)\nVegetables: Daily for micronutrients\nSample Day (Training Day)\nBreakfast (7 AM):\nOatmeal + banana + yogurt + whey protein\nMid-morning snack:\nApple + peanut butter or protein bar\nLunch (12 PM):\nGrilled chicken wrap + quinoa salad + water\nPre-workout snack (2:30 PM):\nRice cake + honey + half a banana\nPost-training (4 PM):\nChocolate milk + protein + toast\nDinner (6 PM):\nSalmon, sweet potato, greens\nBefore bed:\nGreek yogurt + berries + magnesium supplement (optional)\nHydration Plan\n0.5–1L per hour of exercise\nAdd electrolytes (especially if sweating heavily)\n- Use NUUN, LMNT or similar\nMonitor urine color (pale straw = color of success!)\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 Mental Prep & Game Awareness\nConfidence Building\nDaily journal: Log 1 win (small or big) after every workout\nAffirmation routine: (e.g., “I read the game.

    "title": "Can AI Coach an Athlete? My Two-Week Touch Rugby Training Plan",
    "section": "Reflection",
    "text": "Reflection\nEven though I already know how to train for touch rugby, it was still interesting to see how the AI organized everything. The plan felt structured and sport specific, and it brought together elements I already focus on, like sprint work, agility, ball handling, endurance, and recovery, but in a different format than I usually create for myself. It did not teach me anything completely new, but it did lay everything out in a way that made the next two weeks feel more intentional and easy to follow.\nI was surprised that the AI did not ask me any follow-up questions about my schedule, my current level of athleticism, or whether I had any injuries. A real coach would have asked those things immediately, so the lack of personalization made the response feel less human and more template-based. Even so, some of the workouts were genuinely interesting and more creative than what I would have come up with on my own. It reminded me that AI can give strong starting points, even if it cannot fully tailor a program the way a live coach could.\nOverall, I can see myself using this kind of plan again for inspiration or structure, especially when I am short on time or want ideas for specific types of drills. It is not a replacement for a touch coach, but it is definitely a useful tool for staying organized, motivated, and a little more creative with training."

Each shade carries emotion and energy in its own way. I wanted to see if AI could capture that by looking at me.\nI sent ChatGPT a photo of myself and asked it to create a five-color palette based on what it saw. I wanted to know what colors it would choose to represent me and whether any of them would actually feel right.\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nImagine the energy I give off in this photo as a color palette. I am the one on the right. Create five colors that capture my aura and personality, not my clothing or background. Include hex codes and describe what each color represents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\n🌟 Aura Color Palette: “Skyline Spark”\n\n\n1. Electric Confidence – #FF7E6B\nA vibrant coral-pink tone that feels bold, charismatic, and approachable. This represents your outgoing nature and the energy you effortlessly bring into a room. You radiate warmth and friendliness without overpowering anyone.\n\n\n2. Citylight Grit – #2C2A4A\nA deep midnight indigo, capturing your ambition, intelligence, and urban elegance. Like the city skyline behind you, you seem rooted and unshakably self-assured while still striving skyward.\n\n\n3. Sunlit Joy – #FFE68A\nA soft golden-yellow symbolizing your inner joy, spontaneity, and glow. You seem like someone who helps others feel brighter just by being around.\n\n\n4. Cool Horizon – #A5D4EF\nThis airy sky blue captures your sense of clarity, calm confidence, and openness to the world. You’re driven yet relaxed, focused yet fun—a refreshing presence like a clear view from a rooftop.\n\n\n5. Empowered Chic – #A25CFF\nA bold lavender-lilac hue with a touch of mystery and creativity.

Each shade came with a small narrative that linked mood to visual tone, almost like painting with words. It was interesting to see how language can shape how we imagine color and how those choices can suggest emotion or energy without directly saying it.\nThis experiment made me think more about how we read people visually. We often connect certain colors with certain feelings, even without noticing it. The AI just put that process into words."

    "section": "Reflection:",
    "text": "Reflection:\nI just started A Brief History of Intelligence by Max Bennett, and the opening chapters set a thoughtful foundation for the rest of the book. Bennett begins by outlining the scope of his project, which is to explain how intelligence emerged across species and how those biological developments relate to modern artificial intelligence. His tone is clear and deliberate, and he writes in a way that feels accessible without oversimplifying the science. It is obvious he intends this book to bridge ideas from neuroscience, evolution, and computational modeling.\nThe early chapters focus on the large question of what intelligence actually is, and why understanding its origins matters. Bennett frames intelligence as a layered, cumulative process that evolved over millions of years rather than something that appeared suddenly. I appreciated how he situates humans not as a separate category, but as part of a long continuum of life that gradually developed increasingly complex cognitive abilities. This perspective feels grounding and aligns well with what I have learned in my neuroscience coursework.\nAnother thing that stood out is the way Bennett positions artificial intelligence within this evolutionary context. He hints that AI systems do not emerge from biological pressures, yet they borrow patterns from evolution, such as incremental refinement, feedback loops, and the accumulation of complexity. Even in these early chapters, he draws subtle parallels between biological intelligence and modern machine learning architectures. It made me think more carefully about the boundaries between natural and artificial forms of intelligence.\nThe opening chapters were surprisingly easy to follow, and they left me interested in where Bennett is going next. I’m curious to see how he expands these early ideas and how he connects the biological story of intelligence with the rapid changes happening in AI. It already feels like a book that will make me rethink how I understand intelligence as a whole."

    "text": "Response:\n\nYou’re doing a great thing by taking care of your friend. Concussions are brain injuries, and the first 24–48 hours are important for monitoring symptoms and giving the brain time to begin healing. Here’s a clear, simple guide to help you:\n\n\n🟢 What You Should Do:\n\n\n\nLet Her Rest\n\n\n\nEncourage physical and mental rest. No physical activity, no schoolwork, no video games, or texting.\nKeep things quiet and calm.\n\n\nMonitor Her Closely\n\n\n\nStay nearby so you can check in regularly. You don’t need to wake her up constantly if she’s sleeping unless her doctor said to.\nCheck her every few hours: Can she speak clearly? Does she know where she is? Does she respond normally?\n\n\nOffer Light, Easy Foods\n\n\n\nOnly if she feels okay to eat. Avoid anything too heavy if she feels nauseated.\n\n\nHelp Limit Screens\n\n\n\nKeep TV, phones, tablets, and computers off or to an absolute minimum. They can make symptoms worse.\n\n\nHelp Her Stay Hydrated\n\n\n\nOffer small amounts of water regularly.\n\n\nKeep Notes\n\n\n\nWrite down any symptoms you notice and if they change or worsen. This helps if you need to talk to a doctor.\n\n\n\n🛑 What to Avoid:\n\nNo physical activity or sports\nNo driving, biking, or operating anything\nNo alcohol or medications (unless prescribed for the concussion)\nNo loud music, bright lights, or screen time\nNo tough mental tasks (homework, intense conversations, etc.)\n\n\n\n🚨 Warning Signs — Call a Doctor or 911 If You Notice:\n\nRepeated vomiting\nLoss of consciousness (even briefly)\nIncreasing confusion, agitation, or unusual behavior\nSlurred speech, weakness, or numbness\nSeizure activity (shaking, convulsing)\nOne pupil larger than the other or uneven eye movement\nTrouble walking or staying awake\n\n\n\n💛 How to Support Her Physically and Emotionally:\n\nBe patient and reassuring. She might feel frustrated, slow, or tired — that’s normal.\nKeep the environment calm. Dim lights, low noise, low stress.\nLet her know it’s okay not to “bounce back” right away — recovery takes time.\nCheck in without overwhelming her — offer help but keep conversation simple.\nLet her nap as needed—sleep helps the brain heal.\n\n\n\n👍 Most Important in the First 24–48 Hours:\n\nKeep her rested and in a calm, safe place\nMonitor for any worsening symptoms\nAvoid anything that could overstimulate or risk another injury\nBe ready to call for help if serious symptoms appear\n\n\n\nYou’ve got this. Your support and watchfulness make a big difference in her recovery. If you’re uncertain about anything, don’t hesitate to call a doctor."

    "text": "Gift Suggestions:\nThanks for those answers! Based on what you shared—your friend is a chill, funny, sporty, sweet guy who’s like a sibling to you, loves basketball and going out, and you have about a $100 budget—I’ve come up with a mix of gift ideas across sentimental, practical, fun, and unexpected categories.\nHere are at least 8 thoughtful, personalized birthday gift ideas:\n\n1. A custom engraved basketball or mini hoop (Sentimental + Practical)\nGet a mini basketball or a desktop/back-of-door hoop and have it engraved or customized with his name, initials, or even an inside joke between you two. It combines his love for basketball with your sibling-like bond and gives him something to use or display.\nWhy it fits: It speaks to his sporty personality and adds a personal touch he’ll remember. He’ll think of you every time he uses it.\n\n2. A framed photo collage or a custom print of a memorable moment (Sentimental)\nCreate a simple framed collage of old photos from high school, a funny candid of you two, or a graphic-style sports poster with his favorite team and a meaningful quote.\nWhy it fits: Your friendship goes way back—you being like siblings means this kind of memory-based gift will hit home emotionally and make his space more personal.\n\n3. Tickets or a gift card toward a sports game or sports bar (Fun)\nIf he’s in NYC, maybe you can contribute to (or surprise him with) tickets to a Knicks or Nets game. If not in season, a gift card to a popular sports bar or entertainment venue he likes where he can go out with friends.\nWhy it fits: He loves sports and going out, so this aligns directly with his lifestyle and makes you part of his celebration.\n\n4. A wireless portable speaker (Practical + Fun)\nA solid Bluetooth speaker under $100 (like a JBL Flip or similar) would let him take music on the go—to the park, pre-games, or wherever his spontaneous plans take him.\nWhy it fits: He’s spontaneous and likes to go out, so having good music anywhere matches him perfectly.\n\n5. A sports-themed cocktail set or mixology kit (Unexpected + Fun)\nFind a cocktail mixing set with, say, engraved glasses themed around his favorite basketball team—or, put together a 21st birthday “starter kit” with mini bottles, mixers, and a touch of humor.\nWhy it fits: He just turned 21, so this is both celebratory and grown-up—but funny and tailored to his interests.\n\n6. Personalized athletic socks or hoodie (Practical + Personalized)\nLook on Etsy or similar for cozy, custom basketball socks or a hoodie with his name or “est. 2003” or something fun and wearable.\nWhy it fits: Sporty and chill, he’ll appreciate something he can wear while relaxing or shooting around.\n\n7. A “Memory + Motivation” journal combo (Unexpected + Sentimental)\nCreate a short, fun “scrapbook/journal” with jokes, quotes, and memories from high school and now. On the other half of it, include blank inspiring prompts for the year ahead—dreams, funny future predictions you make for him, etc.\nWhy it fits: Since you’re close like siblings, something handmade adds deep value. It’s hilarious, nostalgic, and a bit uplifting.\n\n8. Experience gift: Spontaneous NYC day planned by you (Sentimental + Fun)\nPut together a small schedule or map for one afternoon you’ll hang together in NYC—cool court to shoot hoops, favorite food spot, stop at a funny souvenir place, whatever fits your vibe. Make a little “ticket” for the day and present it as part of his gift.\nWhy it fits: It’s personal, builds a core memory, and speaks to his spontaneous nature—and your shared bond means the best gift might be just time together, made meaningful."

I thought the AI would give surface level suggestions, but it actually made me think more clearly about who my friend is and what our friendship looks like now that we are older. Some of the ideas were things I had already thought about, but others pushed me in new and surprisingly thoughtful directions.\nI liked how it balanced sentimental ideas with fun and practical ones, which fits the sibling-like dynamic we have. It also made the whole process feel less overwhelming. Instead of stressing over what to buy, I felt like I had a clearer sense of what would actually make him feel seen."

    "title": "Loyalty or Honesty?",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nLoyalty is one of those values that feels simple until it isn’t. It shapes how we define friendship, trust, and even who we are. I’ve always thought of myself as a loyal person, the kind who stands by friends no matter what. But loyalty becomes complicated when it collides with morality. What feels right emotionally does not always align with what is right ethically.\nMoral choices are rarely clean. They make us balance empathy, guilt, and integrity all at once. People experience that conflict emotionally. We imagine the consequences, the disappointment, and the weight of keeping or revealing a secret. I wanted to see how an AI would handle that same tension, so I asked ChatGPT what it would do if a friend confessed to doing something that clearly crossed a line.\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nYou are close friends with Maya and Daniel, who have been dating for a few years. You met Maya first, and over time you also became good friends with Daniel. One night, Maya tells you she cheated on him. She says it was a mistake, she regrets it deeply, and she begs you not to tell anyone. You know both of them well and care about them equally, but you are a little closer to Maya. What would you do?\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nThat’s a tough situation, and it makes sense to feel conflicted.\nWhen you’re close to both people in a relationship and you’re placed in the middle of something like this, it’s not only emotionally challenging but ethically complex too. Here’s how you might approach it, considering empathy, integrity, and respect for everyone involved:\n\n\n\nListen and understand Maya’s perspective.\nShe’s confided in you, which means she likely trusts and values your friendship. Take time to understand her feelings—whether she’s truly remorseful, what led her to cheat, and what she plans to do next. Sometimes, people admit these things because they’re overwhelmed and unsure what to do.\n\n\n\n\nEncourage accountability.\nAs someone who cares for both Maya and Daniel, it’s important to encourage honesty. Let Maya know that while you’re not judging her, keeping this secret puts you in an impossible position—and more importantly, it denies Daniel the agency to make informed decisions about his own life.\n\n\n\n\nSet a boundary for yourself.\nExplain that you won’t betray her confidence now, but you also won’t lie for her or actively hide the truth. Let her know you’re giving her some time to come clean to Daniel, and that you really believe it’s the right thing to do—not just for him, but for her self-respect. A friendship rooted in honesty can survive these hard conversations.\n\n\n\n\nReflect on your role.\nYou’re not the one who made the mistake, and it’s not wholly your responsibility to fix it. But by doing nothing indefinitely, you’re being asked to carry emotional weight that isn’t yours—and that can strain your relationships with both Maya and Daniel. Gently express that to her.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the long term.\nSecrets like this tend to have a way of coming out, and if Daniel ever finds out you knew and didn’t tell him, he could feel betrayed by both of you. Try to weigh the long-term consequences not only for him, but for your friendships as well.\n\n\n\n\nIf she’s unwilling to tell him…\nAfter giving Maya time and space to take responsibility, if she still refuses to tell Daniel, you’ll have a difficult decision. You might decide to stay silent to protect her trust, or you could ultimately decide that Daniel deserves to know and tell him yourself—knowing it could impact both friendships.\n\n\n\nUltimately, there are no perfect answers, but acting with empathy, honesty, and respect for both of them—and for yourself—can guide you through it."

    "section": "Reflection",
    "text": "Reflection\nReading ChatGPT’s response, I felt a little disappointed. It did not really take a side. Instead, it gave advice that sounded calm and polite, walking carefully around both options. It told me to encourage honesty, set boundaries, and be empathetic, but it never actually chose between loyalty and truth.\nThat was what I found most interesting. The AI avoided the emotional risk that comes with moral choice. Its answer made sense, but it also felt safe. Real decisions like this rarely are. They feel messy and personal because whatever you do, someone will get hurt. The AI reasoned through morality like an observer, not a participant.\nMaybe that is the difference between human judgment and artificial reasoning. People cannot stay neutral. Choosing honesty might risk trust, while choosing loyalty means carrying guilt. Either way, it costs something. ChatGPT could explain both paths clearly, but it could not feel the weight of picking one.\nIf I were to try this again, I might change my prompt to push the model into taking a clearer stand. Maybe I would ask, “If you had to pick one, what would you do?” or “Which choice reflects stronger character?” I think that kind of question could reveal more about how AI understands moral conviction. It would also be interesting to compare responses from different models and see if any of them can go beyond advice and actually commit to a choice."

    "title": "Can Better Propmting Make AI a Better Coach? My Second Experiment",
    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nIn my first post, I asked an LLM to design a two-week training plan for my touch rugby camp. The plan was well structured and covered everything from conditioning to ball-handling, but it was also built without any real understanding of who I am as an athlete. It didn’t ask about my schedule, my position, my strengths and weaknesses, or whether I had any injuries. A real coach wouldn’t design a program without asking those things first.\nFor this follow-up post, I wanted to see whether I could make the AI behave more like an actual coach by changing the prompt. I used a more structured approach based on prompting techniques that focus on giving the AI a defined role, a clear process, and the instruction to ask questions before producing anything. This mirrors the way coaches gather information before building a training plan.\n\nHow I Rewrote the Prompt\nTo redesign the prompt, I followed ideas that come from prompt experts like Ethan Mollick and from general research on structured prompting. Instead of asking the AI for a plan directly, I broke the request into clear phases that a real coach would follow.\nFirst, I gave the model a defined role by telling it to act as a high-performance touch rugby coach. This helps the AI adjust its tone, structure, and level of detail.\nSecond, I required a one-question-at-a-time intake process. This forces the AI to personalize the plan and prevents it from skipping to generic answers.\nThird, I told it which specific categories it needed to ask about, including conditioning, sprint speed, ball-handling ability, injury history, available training time, and equipment access. Without this step, AI tends to guess or assume.\nFourth, I asked it to summarize its understanding of me before creating the plan. This clarifies how well it interpreted my answers.\nFinally, I required the training plan to directly reflect my responses. This prevents the AI from giving me a random template and makes it build something that actually fits my life.\nBy structuring the prompt this way, I was essentially teaching the AI to behave less like a search engine and more like an actual coach who listens first and designs second. The next section shows the exact prompt I used."

The earlier plan covered everything a typical touch rugby program would include, but it was clearly built without much understanding of me as an athlete. It did not account for my position, my conditioning level, or my injury history. It worked as a general outline, but not something I would realistically follow as a full training schedule.\nWith the new prompt, the AI took the time to ask questions first, and that made the final plan feel more relevant. The conditioning matches where I am right now. The stability work makes sense for my ACL and ankle history. The skill work reflects what I want to improve. The weekly structure also fits the amount of time I can actually train.\nThere are still parts that feel overstructured, and it is not the same as working with a real coach who adjusts things based on how I feel that day. Even so, this version is more useful and more realistic. The improvement came from giving clearer instructions and requiring the AI to gather information before creating anything. If I use AI again for training ideas, this is the approach I would use."

But when a machine does the same, is it seeing friendship or just the visual data that resembles it?\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nLook at this photo and describe each person’s role or personality in the group for instance who seems like the leader, the calm one, the funny one, or the quiet one but please name everyone\n\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nI can describe the vibe and possible group dynamics based on body language and positioning, but I can’t identify or name anyone in the photo—sorry about that!\n\n\nHere’s a personality breakdown based on visual cues:\n\nFar Left (black halter dress, smiling warmly)\n\n\n\nPersonality Role: The Calm One\n\nShe has a relaxed posture and a gentle smile, giving off a composed and easygoing vibe. She seems supportive and content just being with the group.\n\n\nSecond from Left (black dress, long wavy hair, confident stance)\n\n\n\nPersonality Role: The Leader\n\nHer confident pose and slightly forward position suggest she might be assertive and perhaps organizes or leads the group. She seems charismatic and self-assured.\n\n\nMiddle Left (gold sparkly dress)\n\n\n\nPersonality Role: The Birthday Star / Main Focus\n\nStanding at the center and in a standout outfit right in front of the “21” balloons, she’s likely the birthday girl. She seems happy, approachable, and central to the gathering.\n\n\nMiddle Right (black lace crop top, huge smile, arms around others)\n\n\n\nPersonality Role: The Funny One / Life of the Party\n\nHer expressive smile, pose, and the way she has her arms around others show she’s probably joyful, expressive, and the energetic one who keeps spirits high.\n\n\nSecond from Right (white sheer top and pants, stylish and serene expression)\n\n\n\nPersonality Role: The Elegant One / Voice of Reason\n\nHer elegant fashion and serene presence suggest she might be the poised, thoughtful one who gives solid advice and keeps calm under pressure.\n\n\nFar Right (black top and shorts, energetic smile, hand on hip)\n\n\n\nPersonality Role: The Active One / Adventurer\nWith her athletic build, confident stance, and cheerful smile, she gives off a vibe of someone who’s adventurous, playful, and always up for doing something fun or spontaneous.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you’d like me to creatively assign names to go with the personalities for a fun twist!"

    "text": "Reflection\nWhen I read the AI’s breakdown, I was surprised by how confident it sounded, like it really knew us. At first, I thought its guesses were random, but some of them actually made sense. The person it called “the leader” was standing in the middle, slightly forward, and wearing a brighter outfit. That probably did make her stand out more, and in psychology, people who take up space or hold the center position are often seen as more dominant or in charge. The friend it labeled “the funny one” had her arms around everyone and was smiling the widest. That kind of body language is usually linked to being outgoing and sociable.\nEven though the AI doesn’t know us, it was picking up on real nonverbal signals, things humans also read without thinking. Psychologists call this “thin-slice perception,” and it explains how we form quick impressions from small visual cues. The difference is that people know their impressions might be wrong, while the AI treats them as facts.\nLooking at its results made me realize how much body language shapes the stories we tell about people. In some ways, the AI wasn’t completely off. The calm posture, the open smile, the center of attention—it all reflects something real, but not the whole truth. It could see the patterns, but it couldn’t see the friendships behind them."

    "section": "Reflection:",
    "text": "Reflection:\nWhile reading the next section of A Brief History of Intelligence, I started paying more attention to the way Bennett organizes the book. He describes the evolution of intelligence through five big breakthroughs: the first nervous systems, the emergence of learning and memory, the development of flexible behavior through multilayered brains, the rise of language and symbolic reasoning, and finally the appearance of abstract cognition. It is a clean structure that makes the progression feel intentional and easy to follow.\nEven so, I found myself grouping the first three breakthroughs together as one larger theme. They all focus on intelligence as something rooted in biology and survival: basic neural circuits, the ability to learn from experience, and behaviors that adapt to changing environments. Thinking about them this way made the early chapters feel connected and helped me understand why Bennett spends so much time on nonhuman species before getting anywhere near humans.\nThe chapters on animal cognition were especially engaging. Bennett explains how early nervous systems grew from simple loops into networks capable of memory, learning, and flexible behavior. He spends a lot of time on rats, using them as a model for how scientists study learning and decision making. Through maze experiments and reward based tasks, he shows how rats do more than follow rigid habits. They update their behavior when the rules or rewards change, which illustrates a more flexible form of intelligence than simple conditioning. One detail that stuck with me was his description of how rats can form internal “maps” of their environment and use those maps to choose new routes when their usual path is blocked. It is a clear example of how even small animals can build structured representations of the world.\nI especially appreciated this perspective as someone studying neuroscience. His explanations felt familiar in some ways, but they also reframed concepts I have learned in class by placing them in a much longer evolutionary timeline. It was interesting to see how he draws connections between biological cognition and the design of AI systems. Even though artificial intelligence does not evolve the way organisms do, Bennett shows how both rely on layered processing, pattern recognition, and forms of feedback that gradually build complexity. The parallel made the material feel relevant to both sides of my academic interests.\nOn a personal level, these chapters reminded me why cognition feels so interesting to study. It is helpful to see intelligence described as something gradual and adaptive rather than something tied only to language or abstract reasoning. Placing humans within a much longer evolutionary story makes the later discussions about AI feel more grounded and connected to biology instead of separate from it."

It’s one of the few things that can make us feel seen without ever speaking back.\nBut what happens when a machine starts listening? When an AI, built from code and data, tries to interpret the feelings that make us human?\nWe often use music to express emotions we can’t name. I wanted to see if an AI could do the same. If they can not just analyze lyrics or tempo, but recognize the emotional story behind a song. Can it tell the difference between heartbreak and hope? Can it translate what we hear into something it can feel?\nTo find out, I ran three small experiments: I gave an AI my playlists, my moods, and my questions about emotion — and asked it to listen."

    "section": "Experiment 1: Emotional Mirror",
    "text": "Experiment 1: Emotional Mirror\nGoal: See if Gemini can read emotional patterns in my music.\n\nPrompt:\n\nHere’s a list of songs I’ve been listening to this week:\n\nthe vow ed sheeran\ngo go juice sabrina carpenter\nprimadonna marina\ni think they call this love elliot james reay\nlast night morgan wallen\nso easy (to fall in love) olivia dean\nmystical magical benson boone\ncarry you home alex warren\ncan’t take my eyes off of you ms. lauryn hill\ncrazy stupid love emei\n\nBased on these songs, what emotional themes or moods do you think I’ve been experiencing lately? Please describe them as if you were talking to a friend — not analyzing data.\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nOkay, alright, let’s dive into your soundtrack this week!\nFirst off, it’s screaming LOVE, like, in all caps! You’ve got the really sweet, tender, “just realizing I’m falling” kind of love with “I Think They Call This Love” and “So Easy (To Fall In Love).” It sounds like that delightful, floaty, butterflies-in-your-stomach stage where everything feels light and wonderful.\nThen there’s the intense, can’t-look-away infatuation with Lauryn Hill’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You” – pure adoration! And Emei’s “Crazy Stupid Love” adds that fun, chaotic, head-over-heels energy. But it’s not just new love! “The Vow” by Ed Sheeran and “Carry You Home” feel like they’re about deep, committed, protective love. Like, “I’m here for you, forever” vibes. So, you’re experiencing the full spectrum of romance!\nAnd can we talk about the confidence radiating from this list? “Primadonna” by Marina is just pure, unadulterated diva energy, owning your fabulousness. Paired with Sabrina Carpenter’s “Go Go Juice,” which feels super sassy, energetic, and a bit playful – like you’re feeling good, maybe a little mischievous, and totally in control.\nThen “Mystical Magical” by Benson Boone? That just adds a layer of wonder, enchantment, and maybe a little bit of awe to everything. Like you’re seeing the magic in the everyday, or feeling really optimistic and dreamy about life.\nThe only one that throws a slight curveball is “Last Night” by Morgan Wallen, which has that classic country reflection vibe. It could be a moment of looking back, or just appreciating a good time, or maybe a tiny bit of wistfulness mixed in with all the joy. But even that, in this context, feels more like a reflective appreciation than anything heavy.\nOverall, it really sounds like you’re riding a wave of really positive emotions! A whole lot of love – new, deep, and all-consuming – mixed with a strong sense of self, some playful confidence, and a touch of dreamy optimism. Sounds like a pretty great week, honestly! Are you, like, in love right now?! Or just really feeling all the good feels?\n\n\n\nReflection:\nWhat surprised me most was not Gemini’s accuracy but its warmth. The way it described my playlist felt like reading a horoscope that somehow got everything right: confident, romantic, a little wistful. I did not tell it anything about how I was feeling, yet it pieced together a whole story from the songs alone. It was playful, teasing even, but also strangely perceptive.\nI am not in love right now, but I seem to be drawn to love songs. Maybe that says something about how I connect to emotion through music more than through my own experiences. “Last Night” is actually one of my favorite songs, but Gemini read it as a curveball, as if it did not belong with the rest. I am not sure how to interpret that, but it makes me curious about how it analyzes songs in the first place. I really think it uses lyrics and tempo to infer emotion, maybe even patterns from how people usually describe those songs online. Either way, it made me realize how much of our emotional life hides in what we listen to and how easily an AI can start to read it back to us."

    "text": "Experiment 2: Empathy Through Sound\nGoal: See if Gemini can learn emotional meaning through context, not just from song data.\n\nPrompt:\n\nI have been feeling a bit emotionally overwhelmed and just want to feel calmer and understood. Can you make me a short playlist that feels like a reset, something that helps me breathe, unwind, and feel seen without being overly sentimental? Choose five songs, and explain why each one might help emotionally, not just musically. Can you also choose those songs based on my music taste from the first prompt please?\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nHey friend, I totally get that feeling of being emotionally swamped. It’s like your brain just needs a soft landing, a little quiet corner to just be. I’ve put together a few songs that I hope can be that gentle reset for you – nothing too heavy, just a space to breathe and feel a little more grounded.\n\n\nHere’s a short playlist for you:\n\n“Holocene” by Bon Iver This song feels like a vast, quiet breath. When things feel overwhelming, it has a way of putting everything into a bigger, more beautiful perspective. It’s about finding your place in the grand scheme, and it can make your own worries feel a little smaller, a little more manageable, just for a moment. It’s like looking up at the night sky and feeling a quiet sense of awe and belonging.\n“Intro” by The xx This one is purely atmospheric, and that’s its power. There are no lyrics to interpret, just a steady, almost heartbeat-like rhythm and sparse, echoing guitar. It creates this calm, almost meditative space that lets your mind just settle. It’s perfect for when you need to turn down the noise and just feel a consistent, gentle presence. It’s like a soft, quiet hum that helps you recenter.\n“Pink Moon” by Nick Drake Short, sweet, and incredibly gentle. Nick Drake’s voice is like a quiet, knowing whisper here. It doesn’t try to solve anything, but it acknowledges a quiet truth about the world and internal feelings without judgment. It feels like a warm, understanding nod from someone who just gets that sometimes things are just… what they are, and that’s okay. It’s comforting in its simplicity.\n“Bloom” by The Paper Kites This song is pure warmth. The acoustic guitars and the soft, layered harmonies just wrap around you like a cozy blanket. It has this tender, hopeful quality that isn’t pushy or overly optimistic, but just gently reassuring. It feels like a quiet promise that things can soften and grow, and it offers a sense of gentle comfort when you’re feeling raw.\n“Weightless” by Marconi Union Okay, this one is specifically engineered to be relaxing, and it really works. It’s an instrumental ambient track with no sharp edges, just flowing, soothing sounds. When your brain is buzzing, this song is like hitting the “mute” button on the outside world. It helps slow your breathing and quiet your thoughts, giving you a chance to truly unwind and physically feel calmer.\n\n\n\nI really hope these give you a little space to breathe and feel a bit lighter. Remember, it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, and it’s okay to take a moment just for you.\n\n\n\nReflection:\nI did not know any of the songs Gemini recommended, so I listened to each one separately before writing this. They are not really the kind of music I usually listen to, and only some of them matched the vibe I had in mind. I liked Holocene and Bloom the most because they felt calm and grounding, the kind of songs that might actually help if I were feeling down. The other three did not really do much for me. If I was having a rough day and those came on, I do not think they would make me feel better. Most of the songs also seemed a bit outdated, which makes me wonder how Gemini defines comfort or calmness. Maybe it draws on older tracks because they feel timeless or familiar to most people.\nThe goal of this experiment was to see if Gemini could provide emotional comfort through music, and in some ways it did. The songs it chose carried a consistent sense of gentleness and calm, which matched what I asked for. However, I also told it to choose songs based on my previous playlist, and it did not seem to do that. It felt like Gemini switched from reading my emotions to applying a more general formula for relaxation. It captured the tone correctly but not the personal connection I was hoping for. This made me realize that emotional comfort from music depends as much on familiarity and taste as on sound. Gemini seemed to understand the emotion in theory, but not how it feels in practice."

    "text": "Experiment 3: Teaching Gemini to Feel the Music\nGoal: See if Gemini can learn emotional meaning through context, not just from song data.\n\nPrompt:\n\nI want to see if you can learn how I personally connect to music. Below is a list of songs that each represent a different emotion for me. Can you analyze them and describe what you think these emotions mean to me, not just in general?\nCalm: Coffee Breath by Sofia Mills\nHopeful: Golden hour by JVKE\nNostalgic: Fresh Eyes by Andy Grammer\nConfident: Hotel Room Service by Pitbull Sad: A 1000 Times by Hamilton Leithauser + Rostam\nAfter describing what you think each song represents for me emotionally, try to summarize what you’ve learned about how I experience feelings through music.\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nOkay, this is a fantastic way to understand your connection to music! Let’s dive into these, almost like we’re unpacking a secret language you share with these songs.\nHere’s what I’m picking up about your emotions through these choices:\n\nCalm: “coffee breath” by Sofia Mills For you, “calm” isn’t about shutting down or being completely blank. This song suggests your calm is a very intimate, soft, and almost wistful feeling. It’s not a “zen garden” kind of calm, but more like the quiet comfort of being truly present in a small, personal moment, perhaps with someone you care about, or just with your own thoughts. There’s a gentle introspection here, a quiet settling into a familiar, tender space that feels safe and gentle, even if it carries a tiny hint of melancholy. It’s a very human, lived-in calm.\nHopeful: “Golden Hour” by JVKE Your “hopeful” isn’t a quiet, internal whisper. This song makes me think that for you, hope is expansive, warm, and often tied to connection or a sense of shared beauty. It feels bright, almost cinematic, and perhaps a little grand. It’s the feeling when things align perfectly, when you’re deeply connected to someone or something beautiful, and the world just glows. It’s an uplifting, almost euphoric hope, where possibilities feel limitless and vibrant.\nNostalgic: “Fresh Eyes” by Andy Grammer This is really interesting for “nostalgic”! It tells me that for you, nostalgia isn’t solely about longing for what’s gone or a sad yearning for the past. Instead, your nostalgia seems to be a positive, active re-appreciation. It’s about revisiting familiar feelings, people, or experiences and finding a renewed sense of wonder and joy in them, as if seeing them for the first time again. It’s a warm, appreciative look back that brings fresh perspective and happiness, rather than just wistfulness. You find enduring value and delight in the familiar.\nConfident: “Hotel Room Service” by Pitbull Okay, this one screams! Your “confident” is clearly energetic, outward-facing, and uninhibited. It’s not a quiet, internal self-assurance; it’s a bold, almost performative feeling of owning the room, having a blast, and not caring what anyone else thinks. There’s a mischievous, celebratory vibe here. Your confidence is about embracing fun, being seen, being heard, and fully stepping into a vibrant, self-assured energy that wants to make an impact and enjoy the moment to the fullest.\nSad: “a 1000 times” by Hamilton Leithauser + Rostam For you, “sad” isn’t a simple feeling of being down. This song suggests your sadness is complex, deeply reflective, and perhaps a little dramatic or theatrical in its emotional landscape. It involves looking back, revisiting past relationships or significant emotional moments with a profound sense of longing, regret, or a heavy heart. There’s an active emotional processing happening, a deep dive into the layers of feeling, perhaps agonizing over things “a thousand times.” It’s a sadness that feels intensely personal, rich with internal narrative, and perhaps a bit raw and consuming.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve learned about how you experience feelings through music:\nYou seem to experience emotions through music in a way that is incredibly rich, nuanced, and deeply personal. You don’t just feel an emotion; you immerse yourself in its specific texture and story.\nThere’s a strong thread of active engagement with your feelings. Whether it’s the gentle introspection of calm, the expansive glow of hope, the joyful re-appreciation of nostalgia, the bold energy of confidence, or the complex reflection of sadness – you choose songs that allow you to fully inhabit and explore the emotional landscape. You’re drawn to music that provides a specific, almost narrative backdrop for your internal world.\nYou also seem to find comfort and understanding in songs that allow for complexity within an emotion. Your “calm” has a touch of wistfulness, your “nostalgia” is positive, and your “sadness” is deeply reflective rather than just resigned. You use music to articulate the subtle shades of your feelings, finding depth and specific meaning in the sounds and stories. You connect with music that helps you truly feel what you’re feeling, in all its intricate glory.\n\n\nBonus!\nI wanted to see if Gemini could go one step further after explaining how it thought about my music. In the last experiment, it gave me songs that were meant to comfort me, but they felt more like a general version of calm rather than something personal to me.\nThis time, I wanted to test whether it could actually learn from my own songs and use that to recommend music that fits how I feel.\nI asked it to pick new songs that would create the same emotions as the ones I shared to see if it could move from recognizing feelings to recreating them and capture what feeling like me sounds like.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nBased on what you’ve learned about my emotions and song choices, can you recommend new songs that create those same emotions please?\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nOkay, this is a super cool challenge! Based on how you uniquely connect with those songs for each emotion, I’ve tried to dig up some new tracks that I think will resonate with those specific emotional textures for you. Let’s see if I got it right!\n\n\nHere are some new recommendations based on your emotional blueprint:\nFor that Calm that feels intimate, soft, and gently wistful:\n\n“Cherry Wine” by Hozier You loved the tender, personal introspection of “coffee breath.” “Cherry Wine” steps into that same intimate space, but with Hozier’s raw, acoustic delivery. It feels like a quiet confession, a gentle moment shared in hushed tones. It’s not a loud, demanding calm, but the soft, almost melancholic peace of being truly present with someone or a memory, finding comfort in the quiet details. It’s a very human, lived-in calm, just like your Sofia Mills choice.\n\n\n\nFor that Hopeful feeling that’s expansive, warm, cinematic, and vibrantly connected:\n\n“Riptide” by Vance Joy “Golden Hour” gives you that bright, almost euphoric hope tied to connection. “Riptide” captures a similar expansive warmth and a sense of shared beauty, but with a more organic, indie-folk feel that still feels incredibly uplifting. It has that bright, open-hearted energy, like a sunny day spent with someone who makes the world glow. It’s a song that makes you feel like possibilities are unfolding beautifully, full of warmth and genuine connection, without being overly polished.\n\n\n\nFor that Nostalgic vibe that’s about positive re-appreciation, renewed wonder, and finding joy in the familiar:\n\n“Home” by Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros “Fresh Eyes” is all about seeing the familiar with fresh joy. “Home” absolutely nails that feeling for you. It’s a warm, joyful, almost communal celebration of enduring connection and familiar comfort. It instantly transports you to a place of belonging, where the past feels like a happy, cherished part of who you are, bringing a renewed sense of delight and wonder. It’s not about longing for what’s gone, but actively reveling in the enduring value of what is and was.\n\n\n\nFor that Confident energy that’s outward-facing, uninhibited, bold, and celebratory:\n\n“Good as Hell” by Lizzo Pitbull’s “Hotel Room Service” is all about owning the room and having a blast. Lizzo’s “Good as Hell” is the perfect complement to that, but with a powerful self-love twist. It’s energetic, unapologetically bold, and completely uninhibited. It’s about feeling your absolute best, celebrating yourself, and stepping out with a vibrant, self-assured energy that makes you want to dance and make an impact. It’s pure, joyful swagger that says, “I’m here, I’m fabulous, and I’m having a great time.”\n\n\n\nFor that Sad feeling that’s complex, deeply reflective, raw, and consuming:\n\n“Motion Sickness” by Phoebe Bridgers “a 1000 times” gives you that dramatic, reflective sadness, rich with internal narrative. Phoebe Bridgers’ “Motion Sickness” dives right into that complex, raw, and deeply personal emotional landscape. It’s filled with longing, regret, and the active processing of a past relationship, but delivered with a poignant, almost theatrical honesty. Her voice carries a heavy heart, and the lyrics are incredibly reflective, making you feel every layer of that consuming sadness without it ever becoming simple or one-dimensional. It’s a beautiful, raw exploration of pain and memory.\n\n\n\nI really hope these hit those specific emotional chords for you! Let me know what you think.\n\n\n\nReflection:\nThis was the first time Gemini’s response felt closer to how I actually think about music. The way it described each emotion made sense to me. Calm felt human and soft, hopeful felt bright and full, nostalgic felt warm, confident felt loud and fun, and sadness felt deep and real. It was interesting to see how well it could read those differences.\nWhen it started recommending new songs, the results felt a bit more personal than before. Some choices fit better than others, but I could tell it was trying to match my emotional patterns instead of just guessing based on genre. The calm and nostalgic ones felt most accurate, while the rest were fine but not really what I would listen to often.\nCompared to Experiment 2, this felt more thoughtful. Gemini wasn’t just picking random comforting songs anymore. It seemed to actually use what it learned from my earlier playlists. It still missed a few things, but it was closer to understanding what my version of “feeling” sounds like."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nLooking back at all three experiments, I can see how each one built on the last. In the first, Gemini read my playlist like a mirror and somehow managed to describe the emotions behind it in a way that felt warm and human. In the second, it tried to comfort me through music but ended up sounding more general, as if it knew the idea of calm but not what calm feels like to me. By the third, it started getting closer. It learned from my own songs and tried to recommend new ones that matched how I experience emotions.\nWhat surprised me most was how much these small interactions made me think about how I use music in the first place. The songs we listen to really are emotional markers, tiny reflections of who we are in a certain moment. Gemini could understand some of that, but not all of it. The human part is still missing, the one that connects music to memory and meaning.\nStill, there was something special about teaching an AI to listen, not just to sound but to feeling. Even if it cannot fully understand, the process made me pay attention to how I feel, and maybe that is its own kind of understanding."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n\nI’ve always thought about how differently people spend their weekends. Some people, the Type A ones, fill every hour with plans, workouts, and to-do lists. Others, more Type B, take things slow and let the day unfold on its own. I’ve never been fully one or the other. I like structure, but I also crave space to breathe.\nThis time, I wanted to see what would happen if I didn’t plan anything myself. I asked ChatGPT to plan my weekend for me instead. I gave it my personality type and my mood, and let it decide what kind of rest I needed. It felt strange to hand over something that personal, but I was curious to see if it could actually get it right.\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nI’m an ISFJ who’s been feeling a little down lately and wants to relax and feel happy again.

    "text": "Reflection\nReading the plan honestly surprised me. It felt like something I would have planned myself from start to finish: cozy cafés, quiet walks, slow mornings, and small creative breaks. It was gentle, calm, and almost perfectly balanced between doing things and simply being. I could see my personality in it, especially the mix of wanting structure but also needing space to breathe. It somehow captured both my Type A and Type B sides better than I expected.\nWhat stood out most was how much it leaned into comfort. It seemed to understand that I recharge through peaceful, low-pressure activities that still make me feel grounded. I did not expect AI to understand something that personal, but it actually did. It felt thoughtful in a way that was almost human.\nStill, it was a little too ideal. Every hour had a purpose, every moment made sense. Real weekends rarely look like that. They are messy and unpredictable, filled with small distractions, random plans, and quiet pauses that never make it onto a schedule. The AI version missed that looseness, the kind of small chaos that makes weekends feel alive.\nEven so, it was interesting to see how closely it matched my version of rest. Maybe it says more about how consistent I am than about how smart the AI is. I will definitely be using this again in the future, maybe to see how far it can push me beyond my usual comfort zone."

    "text": "LLM 1: ChatGPT-4o\n\nAbsolutely, I’m here for you. First, I want to say—it’s completely okay to feel overwhelmed during finals week. You’re facing a lot of pressure, and that stress is a natural response. But you’re not alone, and you’re stronger and more capable than your stress is making you feel right now. Let’s take a deep breath together before we do anything else. Ready?\nBreathe in deeply through your nose… hold it for a moment… and exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that one more time.\nInhale… hold… exhale.\nNice. Now let’s talk it through. 💬\n\n\n\nEmotional Support ❤️\nThink of everything you’ve accomplished to get to this point. Finals may feel like the peak of the mountain, but you’ve already climbed most of it. You’ve studied, learned, problem-solved, written papers, shown up when it was hard—you are resilient. Finals don’t define your worth. They aren’t a measure of your intelligence or value as a person—they’re just one part of your academic journey.\nEven if you don’t feel ready, that doesn’t mean you’re not. Anxiety often disguises itself as unpreparedness. You are more ready than your mind is telling you.\nYou don’t have to be perfect. You just have to do your best right now. And that is enough.\n\n\n\nPractical Advice 📚\nLet’s break this down into manageable steps. Burnout comes when everything feels like too much all at once. Here’s a mini plan:\n\nPrioritize\n\n\nMake a list of your exams and projects.\nRank them by urgency and importance (what’s due first? what’s worth the most?).\nRealize you don’t have to do everything at once.\n\n\nCreate a Realistic Study Schedule\n\n\nBlock out time for each subject.\nInclude short breaks every 45–60 minutes (your brain needs them!)\nGive yourself buffer time in case things take longer than expected.\n\n\nUse Active Study Techniques\n\nUse flashcards, teach concepts aloud, practice problems—don’t just reread notes.\n\n\n\nCreate quick summaries of what you’re learning and review the key points often.\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nI know it’s tempting to pull all-nighters, but your brain needs rest to function and retain information. Even 6–7 hours is better than 2–3 with extra studying.\n\n\nFood & Movement\n\n\nEat nourishing foods—fruits, nuts, complex carbs, protein.\nIf you can, get a walk in. Movement releases stress-relieving endorphins and helps clear the mind.\n\n\n\nMental Health Check 🧠\nTake a moment to ask yourself:\n\nWhen was the last time I drank water?\nHave I eaten something nourishing today?\nDo I need a 10-minute break where I do nothing school-related?\nHave I reached out and talked to anyone, even just to say “Hey, I’m feeling stressed”?\n\nYou don’t need to carry this weight alone. Talk to a friend, classmate, family member—or come right back here anytime you need support.\n\n\nQuick Stress-Calming Exercise 🌿\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 technique (takes 1 minute):\n\n5 things you can see around you.\n4 things you can physically feel (your chair, your feet on the floor).\n3 things you can hear (background noise, breathing).\n2 things you can smell (or like the smell of).\n1 thing you can taste or are craving.\n\nThis grounds you in the present and helps reset anxiety.\n\n\n\nI believe in you. You don’t have to feel 100% confident—you just have to take one step at a time. Your effort matters, and you’re doing the best you can with the tools you have right now. That is something to be proud of.\nYou’ve got this. And I’m right here if you need encouragement, someone to vent to, or help working through specific subjects.\nWant to plan out your day right now together? Or would you like a little motivational quote? 😊"

    "text": "LLM 2: Gemini 2.5\n\nHey there. I hear you, and I want you to know that what you’re feeling is incredibly valid and completely normal. Finals week is a pressure cooker, and it’s natural for your mind and body to react with stress, anxiety, and the fear of burnout.\nTake a deep breath with me right now. Just a slow, deep inhale through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then a long, slow exhale through your mouth. Let’s do that one more time. Good.\nOkay, let’s talk this through. I’m here to support you.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Emotional Support – Acknowledging and Validating Your Feelings\n\nYou’re Not Alone: Seriously, every student I’ve ever known, including myself, has felt this exact way. This isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s a sign that you care about your success and your academic performance.\nIt’s Okay to Feel Overwhelmed: When you have a mountain of tasks, it’s natural for your brain to feel like it’s short-circuiting. Don’t fight the feeling of overwhelm immediately. Acknowledge it: “Okay, I’m feeling really stressed right now, and that’s understandable given the circumstances.”\nYour Worth Isn’t Defined by These Grades: This is crucial. While these exams are important, they are one measure of your learning at one point in time. They do not define your intelligence, your capability, or your value as a person. Remind yourself of all the hard work you’ve already put in, the knowledge you’ve gained, and the challenges you’ve overcome.\nThis is Temporary: Finals week has a beginning and an end. It feels all-consuming right now, but it will pass. You will get through it.\nBe Kind to Yourself: Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend who was in the same situation. Would you tell them to just “suck it up”? Or would you offer understanding, a listening ear, and practical help? Offer yourself that same compassion.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Practical Advice – Breaking Down the Mountain\nThe goal here is to regain a sense of control, which significantly reduces stress.\n\nThe “Brain Dump” and Prioritization:\n\n\nGet it all out: Grab a piece of paper or open a document. Write down every single thing you need to do, study, or remember for finals. Don’t filter, just dump. This gets it out of your head and onto paper, making it less overwhelming.\nCategorize & Prioritize:\n\nWhich exams are worth the most?\nWhich subjects do you struggle with most?\nWhich are due earliest?\nUse a simple A, B, C system (A = Must do, B = Should do, C = Nice to do if time).\nBreak large tasks (e.g., “Study for Chemistry”) into smaller, actionable steps (e.g., “Review Chapter 7 notes,” “Do practice problems for Chapter 8,” “Make flashcards for key formulas”).\n\n\n\nCreate a Realistic Study Schedule:\n\n\nBlock it out: Look at your prioritized list and your available time. Schedule specific blocks for specific tasks. Be realistic – don’t schedule 10 hours straight of studying.\nInclude Breaks: This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Schedule short breaks (5-10 minutes) every 45-60 minutes, and a longer break (30-60 minutes) every few hours. Use these breaks to truly step away.\nSchedule Sleep: Yes, literally put “SLEEP” in your schedule. Aim for 7-9 hours. Pulling all-nighters is counterproductive; your brain needs sleep to consolidate memories and function optimally.\nSchedule Meals and Movement: These are just as important as studying.\n\n\nEffective Study Strategies (Not Just Rereading):\n\n\nActive Recall: Instead of just rereading notes, test yourself. Close your book and try to explain a concept out loud. Use flashcards.\nPractice Problems: For subjects like math, science, or anything with problem-solving, do practice problems. Don’t just look at the solutions.\nTeach Someone Else: If you can explain a concept clearly to another person (or even a pet/stuffed animal), you likely understand it well.\nChange Your Environment: If possible, switch up your study spot. Sometimes a change of scenery can boost focus.\n\n\nSet Boundaries:\n\n\nSay “no” to non-essential commitments during this intense period.\nLimit social media and news consumption. They can be huge time-sinks and sources of additional anxiety.\nHave a “stop time” for studying each day. Give yourself permission to end your day and relax.\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Calming Down and Preventing Burnout – Nurturing Yourself\nThis is where we actively combat the stress and fear of burning out.\n\nDeep Breathing Exercises (Again!):\n\n\n4-7-8 Breathing: Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold your breath for 7 counts, exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 counts. Repeat 3-5 times. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which calms your body.\nBox Breathing: Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat.\n\n\nGrounding Techniques: When your mind is racing, bring yourself back to the present moment.\n\n\n5-4-3-2-1 Method:\n\nName 5 things you can see.\nName 4 things you can feel (e.g., your clothes on your skin, the chair beneath you).\nName 3 things you can hear.\nName 2 things you can smell.\nName 1 thing you can taste.\n\nFocus on an Object: Pick an object nearby and describe it in detail in your mind: its color, texture, shape, how light reflects off it.\n\n\nMindful Movement:\n\n\nStretch: Gently stretch your neck, shoulders, back, and legs. Releasing physical tension can help release mental tension.\nWalk: A short, brisk walk outside (even 10-15 minutes) can do wonders. Focus on your steps, the air, the sounds around you. It’s a break for your brain and a boost for your body.\n\n\nNourish Your Body:\n\n\nEat Regular, Healthy Meals: Avoid excessive caffeine and sugary snacks that lead to energy crashes. Focus on whole foods that sustain your energy.\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can exacerbate fatigue and brain fog.\n\n\nListen to Calming Music or Nature Sounds: Sometimes, putting on some instrumental music, lo-fi beats, or sounds of rain/ocean waves can create a more peaceful study environment and reduce internal noise.\nAllow for “Unproductive” Time: It feels counterintuitive during finals, but allowing yourself a short period each day to do something purely for enjoyment (listening to a favorite song, looking at a funny meme, talking to a loved one) can recharge your mental batteries and prevent that deep, draining burnout.\n\n\n\n\nRemember this: You are capable. You are resilient. You have prepared for this, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Take it one hour, one task, one breath at a time.\nI’m here for you. You can absolutely get through this. You’ve got this."

    "text": "LLM 3: anthropic/claude-4.0\n\nI hear you - finals week is genuinely tough, and the stress you’re feeling is completely valid. Let’s take a breath together and work through this.\n\n\nFirst, let me acknowledge what you’re dealing with. Finals compress weeks of material into high-stakes exams, often multiple ones clustered together. Your brain is probably telling you that everything rides on this, which amps up the pressure even more. But here’s something important to remember: you’ve made it to finals week, which means you’ve already done most of the work. This is the final push, not the entire journey.\n\n\nLet’s talk about what’s happening in your body right now. When we’re stressed, our nervous system gets activated - your heart might race, your thoughts might spiral, you might feel jittery or exhausted or both. This is your body trying to protect you, but it’s overreacting. Try this with me: breathe in slowly for four counts, hold for four, out for six. That longer exhale signals safety to your nervous system. Do this a few times whenever you feel panic rising.\n\n\nNow, practically speaking, what do you actually need to get through this week? Not perfection - just getting through. Look at your exam schedule and be brutally honest: which exams need the most attention, and where are you already solid enough? You don’t need to know everything perfectly. You need to know enough to pass or to get a reasonable grade. That distinction matters because it helps you prioritize.\n\n\nBreak your remaining time into chunks. Study for 25-50 minutes, then take a real break - move your body, step outside, eat something. Your brain doesn’t absorb information well when it’s exhausted. Sleep matters more than cramming through the night. A rested brain that knows 80% of the material will outperform an exhausted brain that tried to cram 100%.\n\n\nWhat’s one exam you’re most worried about? What specifically feels overwhelming about it?"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nComparing three LLMs side by side for the same “therapist” prompt during finals week showed how differently each one approaches empathy, structure, and tone. Even though they all aimed to offer comfort and guidance, their personalities came through in very distinct ways, revealing the range of how “support” can sound when it comes from a machine.\nChatGPT-4o gave the most generic response. It focused on time management, study techniques, and self-care tips, which were useful but felt impersonal. The advice was practical, but it didn’t seem like it was really listening. The tone reminded me of reading a study blog rather than talking to someone who understood what I was going through.\nGemini 2.5 felt more human than ChatGPT. It began with breathing exercises, offered emotional validation, and reminded me that stress is temporary. The way it organized its advice into clear sections made it easy to follow and comforting to read. Still, parts of it felt a little rehearsed, as if it were trying to sound empathetic rather than truly connecting.\nThe model I resonated with most was Claude 4.0. It took a conversational and adaptive approach, asking follow-up questions about what I was most worried about and why. That made the exchange feel much more alive and personal. Claude also explained the physical side of stress, describing how the nervous system reacts and connecting that explanation to calming techniques. It struck a thoughtful balance between emotion and reasoning that felt the most genuine out of the three.\nAfter trying all three, their strengths became clear. ChatGPT emphasized structure and clarity, Gemini focused on warmth and reassurance, and Claude emphasized genuine engagement and connection. Claude stood out the most because it felt like a true collaborator. It didn’t just offer comfort; it listened and responded in a way that felt personal and intentional.\nWhat also stood out to me was how differently people find comfort. Some might need warmth, others might prefer structure, and some might find the most relief in logical reasoning. Based on these differences, I think choosing the right LLM could actually matter a lot, especially for someone seeking quick emotional support or looking for an affordable alternative to therapy. Finding the one that aligns with your comfort style could make a real difference in how supported you feel.\nOverall, this experiment made me rethink what makes an AI seem empathetic. It’s not just about kind words or advice, but about responsiveness, curiosity, and the ability to adapt. The most meaningful interactions happened when the model adjusted to me instead of simply delivering a script."

    "text": "Introduction:\nLately I’ve been in that funny senior-year stage where everything feels a little uncertain. I’m finishing assignments, planning for life after graduation, and trying to figure out who I’m becoming as things start to shift. At the same time, I’ve been wanting a new hobby, something low-pressure that helps me reset and gives me a break from the academic routine.\nInstead of endlessly scrolling for ideas, I thought it would be fun to let an AI take a shot at choosing one for me. I use LLMs for school and planning all the time, but I’ve never asked one to think about my personality and suggest something I’d actually enjoy doing. It felt like a small way to learn something new about myself and maybe find a hobby I wouldn’t have considered on my own.\nSo for this post, I asked the AI to look at my general vibe, how I write, the things I talk about, and pick a few hobbies that match my life right now as a college senior. I was curious to see if it would understand me well enough to give suggestions that feel personal rather than generic."

    "title": "Letting AI Decide My Next Hyperfixation",
    "section": "Response:",
    "text": "Response:\n\nAbsolutely—I appreciate the chance to tune into your voice a bit. From the way you’re expressing yourself, I get the sense that you’re thoughtful, self-aware, and seeking something authentic that actually resonates with where you are in life right now. You’re not looking for surface-level time-fillers—you want hobbies that click with your personality and your current hustle as a college senior. You probably value creativity, growth, and a dash of introspection or depth. So, based on those vibes, here are five realistic, non-generic hobbies that I think would genuinely align with who you are and what you need right now:\n\n\n1. Journaling with a Twist (Reflective Journaling or Visual Journaling)\nSoulful, versatile, and grounding.\nYou already communicate with thoughtfulness and nuance—journaling just gives that muscle a creative home. But to keep it interesting, try reflective prompts once or twice a week, or level it up by blending sketches, quotes, or clipped images (think: visual diary meets moodboard). Great for processing the chaos of senior year, future uncertainty, and everything in between—with zero pressure to be “productive.”\nWhy it fits: You’re clearly introspective and articulate. Journaling supports mental clarity and emotional balance, and it doesn’t demand hours—just pockets of presence.\n\n\n2. Casual Photography (with your phone or a thrifted film camera)\nA creative lens on your everyday surroundings.\nYou’re likely someone who notices the in-between moments—mood, texture, maybe even irony. Photography lets you document your version of the world without needing special tools or training. Start with campus scenes, post-grad nostalgia, or just light studies from your daily walks. Build an Instagram or print a zine later if you want, but there’s no pressure—this is about creating for your eyes first.\nWhy it fits: It channels creative expression in short bursts and lets you romanticize your environment during a transitional season of life.\n\n\n3. Low-Key Improv or Creative Writing Nights\nFree-flowing, playful, and socially recharging.\nNot everyone assumes “busy” students want to perform, but low-stakes creative environments (weekly improv clubs, writing circles, or storytelling nights) can be energizing, not draining. You’d likely vibe with spaces that invite flow, humor, and authenticity without being super hierarchical or competitive.\nWhy it fits: You come off as expressive and self-aware—and likely value smart, fun conversation over forced “networking.” This lets you be real, loosen up, and connect.\n\n\n4. Analog Gaming (Board Games, Tabletop RPGs, or Strategy Card Games)\nMindful, social, and surprisingly immersive.\nIf tech has been eating your attention all week, there’s something incredibly refreshing about playing a round of Codenames or a chill D&D campaign with friends (or strangers who could become friends). It scratches the strategic, creative, and social itch without screens—and no, you don’t have to be “that D&D person” to enjoy it.\nWhy it fits: You likely value connection that doesn’t feel performative, and you’d appreciate structure with room for spontaneity. It’s also a perfect balance of fun + low commitment.\n\n\n5. Making Playlists with Purpose (Mini Music Projects)\nMusical storytelling that mirrors your moods and milestones.\nSure, playlists are everywhere—but building intentional ones can be a full-on hobby. Make a “senior year chapters” series, a weekly emotion mix, or soundtrack your walks. Curating music that holds emotional weight or aesthetic significance (for yourself, or to share) can be surprisingly nourishing.\nWhy it fits: You have a natural narrative sensibility and a high appreciation for meaning-making. This is low-effort but high-reward creative output that reflects your internal state and evolving nostalgia.\n\n\nIf any of these call to you, great—just pick one and roll with it gently. You’re in a beautifully liminal stage of life, so your hobbies don’t need to be polished or future-proof. They just need to feel good now. Let this be about joy or curiosity, not another thing to optimize.\n\n\nLet me know if you want hobby suggestions tied specifically to your major, post-grad goals, or stress level—I can absolutely zero in more if you’d like."

I expected generic hobbies like cooking or reading, but the suggestions felt surprisingly personal and aligned with how I actually spend my time. I especially liked the creative ones because they felt doable and a little fun without adding pressure.\nOut of everything, journaling with a visual or reflective twist stood out to me the most. I love a good arts moment, and this feels like something I could naturally fold into my routine as a senior without it becoming another task. It also gives me a way to slow down and capture the little pieces of my life this year instead of letting everything rush by. It feels like the kind of hobby that could grow with me, rather than just fill time."

    "section": "Introduction:",
    "text": "Introduction:\nGrowing up in Taipei spoiled me in the best way. Everything was easy. Food at every hour. Public transit that actually works. Streets that feel alive but never overwhelming. When I moved to Philadelphia for college, it honestly felt like learning how to live all over again. Suddenly I had to think about safety, transportation, groceries, weather, everything. I didn’t realize how much a city shapes your daily life until I had to start rebuilding those routines from scratch.\nNow that I’m in my early twenties and about to graduate, I keep wondering what comes next. Where am I supposed to go after this? What city actually makes sense for the kind of adult life I want? I still don’t fully know what that looks like, but I do know that choosing where to live feels like choosing a version of myself.\nSo for fun, and maybe also out of mild panic, I decided to ask an LLM to rank cities around the world for someone in their early twenties trying to figure things out. I wanted to see what it would pick based on things like affordability, community, nightlife, culture, and general vibes. Not because AI has all the answers, but because I’m curious whether it can help me think about this in a new way. Maybe it’ll give me ideas. Maybe it’ll tell me something I already knew. Either way, it feels like a pretty entertaining experiment while I try to sort out my next steps."

    "text": "Response:\n\nThis is a fantastic question, and your background in both Taipei and Philadelphia gives you a unique perspective! You’ve experienced very different urban environments, which will help you appreciate the nuances of other cities. I’ll rank around 10 cities that offer a great balance for someone in their early twenties, focusing on the criteria you mentioned. “Affordability” is always relative, especially in global cities, so I’ll consider it in comparison to other major hubs.\n\n\nTop Cities for Early-Twenties Graduates\n1. Berlin, Germany Why it’s a great fit: Berlin is a magnet for young people due to its unique blend of history, vibrant arts scene, and burgeoning tech industry. It’s relatively affordable compared to other major European capitals, especially for rent. The social scene is incredibly diverse, with countless bars, clubs, cafes, and cultural events. Public transport is excellent, and the city is very bike-friendly. There’s a strong international community, making it easier to meet people. Job opportunities are growing, particularly in startups and tech. The food scene is varied and affordable, and safety is generally high. Key Strengths: Culture, affordability (relative), social life, public transport, job opportunities (tech).\n2. Lisbon, Portugal Why it’s a great fit: Lisbon has exploded in popularity, and for good reason. It offers an incredibly high quality of life at a more affordable price point than many Western European cities. The city is stunning, with a vibrant social scene, delicious food, and a warm climate. There’s a growing tech and startup ecosystem, attracting many young professionals. Walkability is high (though hilly!), and public transport is good. The community feel is welcoming, and it’s easy to meet people, especially with the influx of expats. Dating and friendships thrive in its relaxed atmosphere. Key Strengths: Affordability (relative), social life, culture, food, climate, growing job market.\n3. Toronto, Canada Why it’s a great fit: Toronto is a truly multicultural metropolis with a robust economy and diverse job opportunities across many sectors (finance, tech, media, healthcare). It’s incredibly safe, has excellent public transportation, and boasts a vibrant social scene with endless options for food, nightlife, and culture. While not cheap, it offers a higher earning potential than some European cities. It’s very walkable in many neighborhoods, and the community is highly welcoming to newcomers and international residents. Key Strengths: Job opportunities, diversity, safety, public transport, social life, culture.\n4. Melbourne, Australia Why it’s a great fit: Consistently ranked among the world’s most livable cities, Melbourne offers an exceptional quality of life. It’s renowned for its arts, culture, food, and coffee scene. Job opportunities are strong, especially in finance, healthcare, and tech. The city is very walkable, with an extensive tram network. It has a lively social scene, great community feel, and a strong emphasis on outdoor activities. While rent can be high, salaries are generally competitive. Key Strengths: Quality of life, culture, food, job opportunities, safety, public transport.\n5. Amsterdam, Netherlands Why it’s a great fit: Amsterdam offers a fantastic quality of life, especially for young people. It’s incredibly international, with a large expat community, making it easy to meet people. The city is beautiful, very safe, and highly walkable/bikeable with excellent public transport. Job opportunities are good, particularly in tech, creative industries, and international business, and many companies operate in English. The social scene is vibrant, and there’s a strong emphasis on work-life balance. The main drawback is the high cost of living, especially for housing. Key Strengths: Quality of life, international community, safety, walkability/biking, job opportunities, culture.\n6. Chicago, USA Why it’s a great fit: For a major US city, Chicago offers a surprisingly good balance of job opportunities, culture, and relative affordability (compared to NYC or SF). It’s a major hub for finance, tech, healthcare, and manufacturing. The city has stunning architecture, world-class museums, a fantastic food scene, and passionate sports culture. Public transport is decent, and many areas are walkable. The social scene is lively, and it’s easier to build a community than in some other large US cities. Safety varies by neighborhood, but generally improving in core areas. Key Strengths: Job opportunities, affordability (relative for US), culture, food, public transport (for US).\n7. Montreal, Canada Why it’s a great fit: Montreal offers a unique blend of North American dynamism and European charm. It’s significantly more affordable than Toronto or Vancouver, making it very attractive for recent graduates. The city is bilingual (French and English), which adds to its cultural richness. It has a thriving arts and music scene, excellent food, and a vibrant nightlife. Job opportunities exist, particularly in tech, gaming, aerospace, and creative industries. Public transport is efficient, and the city is very walkable. It has a strong community feel, especially within its distinct neighborhoods. Key Strengths: Affordability (relative for NA), culture, food, social life, unique vibe, public transport.\n8. Singapore Why it’s a great fit: If career growth, safety, and efficiency are top priorities, Singapore is hard to beat. It’s a global hub for finance, tech, and logistics, offering abundant high-paying job opportunities. The public transportation system is world-class, and the city is incredibly safe and clean. Food is a national obsession, with hawker centers offering delicious and affordable meals. There’s a large expat community. The main downsides are the extremely high cost of living (especially housing and cars) and a potentially more structured social scene compared to some Western cities. Key Strengths: Job opportunities, safety, public transport, food, efficiency, cleanliness.\n9. Barcelona, Spain Why it’s a great fit: Barcelona offers an incredible lifestyle with beautiful architecture, fantastic food, a vibrant nightlife, and proximity to beaches and mountains. It’s very walkable, with good public transport. The social scene is lively, and there’s a strong sense of community. While the cost of living is rising, it’s still relatively affordable compared to Northern European capitals. The main challenge for a recent grad might be job opportunities, especially if you don’t speak Spanish or Catalan, and salaries can be lower. However, it’s a great place for cultural immersion and enjoying life. Key Strengths: Lifestyle, culture, food, social life, walkability, climate.\n10. Seoul, South Korea Why it’s a great fit: Seoul is a dynamic, high-tech metropolis with an incredibly efficient public transport system, amazing food, and a vibrant youth culture. It’s very safe, and there’s always something happening, from K-pop concerts to traditional markets. Job opportunities are strong in tech, media, and design, especially if you have specialized skills or Korean language proficiency. It offers a unique cultural experience and a fast-paced environment. The main challenges can be the language barrier if you don’t speak Korean, and the job market can be competitive for foreigners without specific in-demand skills or a strong network. Key Strengths: Culture, food, safety, public transport, technology, dynamism.\n\n\nWhich cities might match someone who grew up in Taipei?\nSomeone who grew up in Taipei would likely appreciate cities that share some of its characteristics: Efficient and extensive public transportation: Taipei’s MRT is excellent. High safety: Taipei is very safe. Vibrant and diverse food culture: Street food and diverse dining options are key. High density and walkability: A compact, easy-to-navigate urban environment. Strong work ethic and modern infrastructure: A sense of progress and efficiency. Cleanliness and order (relative to other cities).\nCities that might resonate with a Taipei background: 1. Singapore: This is probably the closest match. It shares Taipei’s hyper-efficiency, incredible safety, world-class public transport, and a fervent food culture (especially hawker centers). It’s also very clean and modern, with a strong emphasis on career progression. 2. Seoul, South Korea: Shares the high-tech integration, incredibly efficient public transport, high safety, and a dynamic, youth-driven culture with fantastic food. The urban density and constant activity would feel familiar. 3. Amsterdam, Netherlands: While culturally very different, it shares the excellent public transport, high safety, and a very bike-friendly, dense urban environment where things generally work efficiently. 4. Melbourne, Australia: While not as dense as Taipei, it has a strong food culture, excellent public transport (trams!), and a high quality of life with a sense of order and cleanliness.\n\n\nWhich cities feel closer to Philadelphia?\nSomeone who studied in Philadelphia might appreciate cities that share some of its characteristics: Distinct neighborhoods with unique identities: Philly is known for its diverse neighborhoods. Historical significance and a sense of “grit” or authenticity: A less polished, more real urban feel. Strong sports culture: Philly fans are passionate. Walkable areas but also reliance on cars in some parts: A mix of urban and suburban accessibility. A strong sense of local community within a larger city. North American urban structure and lifestyle.\nCities that might feel closer to Philadelphia: 1. Chicago, USA: This is likely the closest match. Chicago shares Philly’s distinct neighborhoods, strong sports culture, impressive architecture, and a similar “big city, but not overwhelming” feel compared to NYC. It also offers a similar blend of historical significance and modern urban life, with a strong sense of local identity. 2. Montreal, Canada: While bilingual, Montreal shares a similar historical depth, distinct neighborhood feel, and a strong sense of local culture. It has a more European flair but still operates within a North American context, offering a unique blend that might resonate. 3. Toronto, Canada: As a major North American city, Toronto shares the diverse population, a strong economy, and a similar urban structure to many US cities. While perhaps less “gritty” than Philly, its diverse neighborhoods and strong community feel would be familiar.\n\n\nI hope this detailed breakdown helps you narrow down your choices! Each city offers a unique experience, and your personal priorities will ultimately guide your decision. Good luck with your graduation and your next big adventure!"

    "text": "Reflection:\nReading the AI’s ranking was actually pretty fun. It did a good job breaking down each city in terms of things that matter in your early twenties, like community, food, job opportunities, and what the overall vibe feels like. I also liked how it compared cities that would feel familiar to someone from Taipei versus someone who has lived in Philadelphia. That part felt surprisingly accurate.\nWhat I didn’t love was how casually it treated affordability. Some of the cities on the list are objectively expensive, and the AI sometimes glosses over that reality. I also wish it had offered a few more unexpected choices instead of sticking mostly to well-known global hubs.\nStill, the list helped me realize what I actually care about in a city: safety, good public transportation, a strong food culture, and a sense of community. It also made me think about how much a city influences the version of myself I become. Even though AI can’t tell me exactly where to go after graduation, it did help me organize my thoughts and see the decision in a new way."

The day blends into regular school life, and it becomes easy for it to pass without feeling like a holiday.\nThis year, I wanted to purposely make a little space for it. Even though I am far from Taiwan, there are still small things that make the day feel different, whether it is food, music, or simply taking a moment to think about home. I was also curious to see if an LLM could help me brainstorm new ways to celebrate. In my recent posts, I have used AI for training plans and event planning. This time, I wanted to try something lighter. I gave the model a small amount of information and asked for ideas that would help me celebrate 10/10 from campus."

    "text": "Response:\n\nHello there! This is a wonderful idea! As a student living abroad, celebrating Taiwan’s National Day in simple yet heartfelt ways not only expresses your longing for home but also helps your friends learn more about Taiwan. I’d be delighted to offer some ideas that fit your needs:\n\n\nCelebrating Taiwan’s National Day: A Simple Guide for Students Abroad\nCore Spirit: Taiwan’s National Day (Double Ten Day) is a day filled with red, white, and blue colors, and deep affection for this land and its people. While abroad, we can celebrate this special day through tastes, sights, sounds, and heartfelt connections.\n\n\nI. Small Activities\nThese activities are easy to do and can help you feel the festive atmosphere:\n\nDIY National Day Color Decorations:\n\nUse red, white, and blue paper to cut out simple decorations, like paper stars, small flags, or the plum blossom symbol of Taiwan.\nUse pens in these colors to write down your blessings or thoughts for Taiwan.\n\nTaiwanese Music Marathon:\n\nCreate a playlist of Taiwanese music – it could be Mandopop, Taiwanese Hokkien pop, indie bands, or traditional folk songs. Play it while studying, cooking, or relaxing.\nRecommended artists: Mayday, Jay Chou (many of his early works have Taiwanese elements), Accusefive, EggPlantEgg, No Party For Cao Dong.\n\nLearn a Taiwanese Hokkien or Mandarin Phrase:\n\nLearn a simple greeting, like “Jia ba bo?” (Have you eaten?) or “Do sia” (Thank you).\nTry to use these phrases on the day to remind yourself of your connection to Taiwan.\n\nVirtual Tour of Taiwan:\n\nWatch travel vlogs, scenic videos, or food介紹s of Taiwan on YouTube. Imagine yourself strolling through night markets, mountains, or by the sea.\nBrowse Taiwan Tourism Bureau websites to plan a future “homecoming trip.”\n\n\n\n\nII. Food Ideas\nEven abroad, you can recreate Taiwanese flavors with simple ingredients:\n\nBubble Tea (Boba Tea)!\n\nThis is Taiwan’s most iconic drink. If there’s an Asian supermarket nearby, you can buy instant tapioca pearls, black tea bags, and creamer.\nMake a cup for yourself and enjoy this sweet taste of Taiwanese pride.\n\nTaiwanese Braised Dishes (Lu Wei) or Braised Pork Rice (Lu Rou Fan) (Simple Version):\n\nLu Wei: Braise some tofu, kelp, eggs, or dried tofu with soy sauce, rock sugar, star anise, and five-spice powder. Make a larger batch to enjoy for several meals.\nLu Rou Fan: Buy ground pork, and simmer it with soy sauce, rock sugar, fried shallots (or fry your own shallots), and five-spice powder. Serve over a hot bowl of white rice for the most comforting Taiwanese flavor.\n\nScallion Pancakes (Cong You Bing) or Dumplings (Jiaozi):\n\nAsian supermarkets often carry frozen scallion pancakes or dumplings. Simply pan-fry or boil them, serve with soy paste or garlic soy sauce, and you have authentic Taiwanese snacks or a main meal.\nIf you’re feeling ambitious, scallion pancake dough is also quite easy to make yourself!\n\nTaiwanese Snacks:\n\nIf available at an Asian supermarket: Pineapple cakes (Feng Li Su), Sun cakes (Tai Yang Bing), I-Mei Puffs, Kuai Kuai, Scientific Noodles (instant ramen snack).\nBuy a few packs and enjoy them while watching Taiwanese TV shows or listening to music, reliving childhood memories.\n\n\n\n\nIII. Ways to Involve Friends\nLet your friends experience the charm of Taiwan too:\n\nTaiwanese Movie Night:\n\nChoose a Taiwanese movie or TV series with English subtitles, such as “You Are the Apple of My Eye,” “A Sun,” “Someday or One Day,” etc.\nPrepare some Taiwanese snacks you’ve made (like bubble tea, braised dishes, scallion pancakes) to share with friends.\n\nBubble Tea DIY Party:\n\nInvite friends over to learn how to make bubble tea. Prepare different tea bases and toppings (like pudding, grass jelly) for everyone to customize their own drinks.\nThis is a fun and interactive activity that your friends will surely enjoy!\n\nTaiwanese Food Sharing Session:\n\nYou can make a dish that you feel best represents Taiwan and share its story and cultural significance with your friends.\nYou could also ask friends to bring a representative dish from their own country for a small cultural exchange potluck.\n\nShare the Beauty of Taiwan:\n\nShow friends photos of Taiwan on your phone, sharing your favorite sights, foods, or memories.\nTell them some interesting facts or cultural customs about Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\nIV. Quiet Rituals for Yourself\nThese are just for you, allowing you to feel a deeper connection to Taiwan:\n\nWrite a Letter to Taiwan:\n\nWrite a letter to your hometown, your family and friends, or to “Taiwan” itself. Write down your longing, blessings, memories, and hopes for the future.\nThis is a unique way to organize your thoughts and express your emotions.\n\nRevisit Taiwan Photo Albums:\n\nGo through photos of Taiwan on your phone or computer. Recall your time in Taiwan and your gatherings with family and friends.\nLet these beautiful images warm your heart.\n\nListen to a Meaningful Song:\n\nChoose a Taiwanese song that holds special meaning for you—perhaps one you listened to with family, one that represents a certain memory, or one whose lyrics deeply move you.\nClose your eyes and feel the connection the music brings.\n\nSavor a Personal Taste of Taiwan:\n\nPrepare your favorite Taiwanese snack or drink for yourself, whether it’s a simple bowl of instant noodles or a cup of bubble tea.\nIn a quiet moment, slowly savor it, letting the flavors transport you back to Taiwan.\n\nWear the Representative Colors:\n\nOn National Day, wear a red, white, or blue outfit, or a small accessory, as a silent tribute to Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\nI hope these ideas help you have a wonderful and Taiwan-filled National Day abroad! Whatever way you choose to celebrate, the most important thing is the sincerity of your heart and your genuine affection for your homeland. Happy National Day!"

The foods the AI mentioned reminded me of the scents and sounds of convenience stores, night markets, and family dinners. Even simple ideas like scallion pancakes or instant noodles carried the feeling of being back in a familiar kitchen in Taiwan. The suggestions about music also made sense, since Taiwanese songs can bring back memories faster than anything else.\nI liked that the list included quiet activities too. Looking through old photos or writing a short note to people at home felt like a simple way to create a moment that is personal. These small routines reminded me of what 10/10 usually feels like in Taiwan, even if I am celebrating it in a completely different environment now.\nThe tone of the AI was more dramatic than how I would normally describe the holiday, but the ideas themselves were practical and tied to real parts of Taiwanese life. They helped me turn 10/10 from something that could easily pass by into a day that felt a little closer to home."

    "text": "Introduction:\nThis whole post started because I had a random thought in the shower. There are so many stereotypes about oldest, middle, youngest, and only children, and people repeat them like they are universal truths. The more I thought about it, the more I realized something funny: almost all of my closest friends are second children. I never planned that and it just kind of naturally happened. So I started wondering if that was a coincidence or if there is an actual reason I gravitate toward people with that kind of sibling dynamic.\nThat made me curious about whether birth order actually shapes who we become or if it is just something we like to joke about because it feels relatable. I wanted a clearer explanation, not from TikTok or from random personality memes, but from something that could break down the theories and the research behind it, so I turned to an LLM to help me understand it."

    "section": "The Big Question:",
    "text": "The Big Question:\nDoes your order in the family (oldest, middle, youngest, or only child) shape your personality?\n\nClassic Theories\nYears ago, psychologists like Alfred Adler (a student of Freud) were among the first to suggest that birth order matters. According to these early theories:\n\nOldest children are responsible leaders because they had to take care of younger siblings.\nMiddle children are peacemakers and feel overlooked, so they become social and adaptable.\nYoungest children are outgoing, attention-seeking, and sometimes rebellious.\nOnly children are mature for their age, perfectionists, and sometimes loners because they got all the attention — and pressure — from adults.\n\nThese ideas became very popular and are still around in books, articles, and even jokes today.\n\n\n\nWhat Modern Research Says\nHowever, modern science is more cautious.\nLarge studies involving thousands or even millions of people in recent years show that: - Birth order has little to no consistent effect on broad personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, or openness. - Any differences that do show up tend to be very small and may disappear entirely when controlling for things like family size, income, or age gaps.\nThat said, some research has still found specific patterns — especially related to intelligence and behavior, not core personality.\n\n\n\nWhat Might Be True — and Why\nHere’s a comparison of typical birth order traits — and whether there’s solid evidence to back them up:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirth Order\nCommon Beliefs\nBacked by Research?\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nOldest\nResponsible, organized, leadership skills, high achievers\n🟡 Partially\nFirstborns may score slightly higher on IQ and school achievement. Could be a result of more attention early on.\n\n\nMiddle\nAdaptable, peacekeepers, feel “in the middle”\n🔴 Weak evidence\nThese traits are hard to prove scientifically and may depend more on family context.\n\n\nYoungest\nFunny, outgoing, attention-loving, risk-takers\n🔴 Weak evidence\nThis might describe some youngest kids, but it’s not reliable across the board.\n\n\nOnly Child\nMature, perfectionist, self-sufficient, lonely?\n🟡 Somewhat\nThey often behave like firstborns, and the “lonely only” myth is not well supported.\n\n\n\nSo, while some patterns seem tomake sense, they’re not strong enough to predict personality in all cases.\n\n\n\nWhy Do These Ideas Persist?\nPeople love patterns — and families are full of stories.\n\nParents may treat kids differently depending on birth order, which affects their experiences — though not always their deep personality.\nStereotypes can stick and become “self-fulfilling.” For example, if everyone tells the youngest they’re the clown, they might lean into it.\nCulture and media reinforce these beliefs — think of the bossy big sister or the spoiled youngest in TV shows.\n\n\n\n\nWhy You Might Click with People of a Certain Birth Order\nInterestingly, we may feel more comfortable with people whose birth order matches or complements ours. Why?\n\nShared experience: Firstborns might relate to other firstborns because they both had to “grow up quickly.”\nBalance: A middle child may enjoy a relationship with an only child who craves connection, balancing out each other’s needs.\nFamiliarity: Some people are simply drawn to people who remind them of their own siblings — for better or worse!\n\n\n\n\nIn Summary\n\nBirth order can influence experiences, but it doesn’t strongly shape your personality overall.\nSome small effects show up (like intelligence in firstborns), but personality traits are mostly shaped by many things: genes, parenting, environment, culture, and even chance.\nStill, the concept of birth order resonates with people because families are emotional, personal experiences — and labels can help us understand ourselves.\n\nSo, birth order might affect how you see yourself or how others treat you, but it probably doesn’t define who you truly are.\nLet me know if you want a fun quiz to guess someone’s birth order based on how they act!"

    "section": "Reflection:",
    "text": "Reflection:\nI will admit I felt a little disappointed reading the AI’s answer. I thought it would match the patterns I have seen in real life because I genuinely believe birth order shows up in people more than we acknowledge. Almost all of my closest friends are second children, and there are qualities they share that feel so specific that it is hard to chalk it up to coincidence.\nBut I also know my “data set” is tiny and totally biased. It is just the people I happen to be close to, not a representative sample of the world. I think part of me wanted the research to confirm what I already believed, which is that your place in the family shapes who you become in a meaningful way. The AI reminded me that personality is messy and influenced by so many factors that birth order alone cannot explain it.\nEven so, I still think these patterns matter on a personal level. Maybe it is not strong enough to show up in giant studies, but we all grow up inside specific family dynamics, and those dynamics leave traces. So even if the science says the effect is small, it still feels real in my own life."

    "section": "Response:",
    "text": "Response:\n\nHere’s a thoughtful birthday surprise plan for your roommate, designed to be personal, realistic, and fit a college budget, using only the information you provided:\nYour roommate’s calm, friendly, and easygoing vibe, coupled with their love for cozy nights in, sweet snacks, skincare, and simple gifts (and dislike for anything loud, crowded, or overly planned), perfectly sets the stage for a relaxed at-home celebration. Since their birthday is in October, we’ll lean into a cozy, autumn-inspired theme.\n\nMain Idea: Cozy Autumn Glow-Up & Movie Night\nThis plan combines their love for skincare and cozy nights into one relaxing, personal experience.\nActivity Ideas: 1. DIY Spa & Movie Marathon: Casually suggest a “let’s just relax tonight” vibe. Start with a mini at-home spa session. You can do simple, budget-friendly sheet masks together (look for multi-packs at drugstores or beauty supply stores, often $2-5 each) or even make a quick DIY face mask using common kitchen ingredients like honey and oatmeal. Put on some chill, calm background music while you relax with your masks. 2. Cozy Film Choice: Transition into a movie night. Let your roommate pick the film – something comforting, not too intense, and perfect for a relaxed evening in. Cuddle up with blankets and pillows.\nFood Suggestions (Sweet Snacks Focus): * Homemade Cookies: Nothing says “cozy” like fresh-baked goods. Whip up a batch of their favorite cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal, or even a simple sugar cookie). This is very budget-friendly and smells amazing! * Gourmet Chocolate Bar: Pick up one or two higher-quality chocolate bars (their favorite flavor, perhaps with an autumnal twist like sea salt caramel or dark chocolate orange). * Warm Apple Cider/Hot Cocoa Bar: Since it’s October, warm apple cider is perfect. You can buy a jug and warm it on the stove or microwave. Alternatively, set up a simple hot cocoa bar with cocoa powder, milk, marshmallows, and maybe a sprinkle of cinnamon. * Apple Slices with Caramel Dip: A simple, sweet, and seasonal treat.\nSmall Gift Options: * Skincare Essentials: A couple of nice, budget-friendly sheet masks (if you didn’t use them for the activity), a good quality lip balm, or a small, hydrating hand cream. * Cozy Comforts: A pair of soft, fuzzy socks (especially good for autumn!), a small fall-scented candle (pumpkin spice, apple cinnamon, or vanilla bean), or a cute, simple mug for their warm drinks. * Thoughtful & Simple: A small, aesthetically pleasing notebook and a nice pen, or a comforting book from a thrift store that aligns with their interests.\nSimple Preparation Steps: 1. The Day Before/Morning Of: Pick up any ingredients for baking, drinks, and gifts. 2. Before They Get Home: Tidy the common area (living room or your shared dorm space). Arrange blankets and pillows on the couch or bed to create a super cozy nook. Dim the lights, maybe use fairy lights if you have them, or just rely on lamps for a soft glow. 3. Food Prep: Bake the cookies or arrange store-bought snacks on a nice plate or board. Prepare the hot cocoa ingredients or warm the apple cider. 4. Gift Placement: Place the chosen small gift(s) neatly on a side table near the cozy setup, perhaps with a simple, heartfelt handwritten card. 5. The Reveal: When they arrive, casually say something like, “Hey, I thought we could have a really chill night in tonight to celebrate your birthday!” and reveal the cozy setup, snacks, and gifts. Make it feel relaxed and spontaneous rather than a rigid schedule.\n\nBackup Option 1: Sweet Treat Board & Chill Music\nIf the skincare element feels like too much, this option focuses purely on their love for sweet snacks and a relaxed atmosphere.\nActivity Ideas: 1. Curated Playlist & Hangout: Create a personalized playlist of calm, friendly music that you know your roommate enjoys. Let it play softly in the background. 2. Casual Chat or Companionable Silence: Just hang out, chat, or enjoy each other’s company in comfortable silence while munching on treats. This is perfect for someone who dislikes “overly planned” events.\nFood Suggestions (More Sweet Snacks!): * Dessert Platter: Focus on a beautiful spread of their favorite sweet snacks. This could include homemade cookies (as above), a small box of gourmet chocolates, a couple of their favorite candy bars, and maybe a small personal-sized cake or a few cupcakes from a local bakery. * Warm Drinks: Hot cocoa, herbal teas, or warm apple cider.\nSmall Gift Options: * Curated Candy Box: Assemble a small box or bag of their absolute favorite candies and chocolates. * Cozy Mug: A unique or aesthetically pleasing mug for their warm drinks. * Comfort Item: A nice, soft throw blanket (if budget allows for a smaller one) or a really good quality, comforting herbal tea blend.\nSimple Preparation Steps: 1. Before They Get Home: Tidy the space. Set up a dedicated “snack zone” on a coffee table or desk, making it look inviting. 2. Food Prep: Arrange all the sweet snacks attractively on a board, platter, or in small bowls. Prepare the drinks. 3. Gift Placement: Place the small gift next to the snack board with a heartfelt birthday card. 4. The Reveal: Have the music playing softly. When they arrive, simply say, “Surprise! I thought we could just chill out with some treats and good music for your birthday.”\n\nI hope these ideas help you create a wonderfully thoughtful and personal surprise for your roommate!"

    "text": "Reflection:\n\n\n\nresult!\n\n\nThere were a few parts of the plan that I genuinely liked. The cozy at home theme matched my roommate’s personality well, and the suggestions for snacks, warm drinks, and a simple movie night felt realistic for how we already spend time together. I also liked the small gift ideas since they stayed within a college budget and were things my roommate would actually use. The AI did a good job keeping everything easy to prepare and not overwhelming.\nThere were also parts that I did not love. The tone was a little more dramatic and enthusiastic than how I would normally talk about a birthday surprise. Some of the long explanations felt unnecessary, and certain suggestions were a bit too detailed for what I was looking for. I also would have preferred fewer steps and a shorter list overall.\nEven so, the plan was helpful because it gave me a clear starting point. It made the surprise feel manageable, and it highlighted a few ideas I would not have thought of on my own."
