    "text": "Introduction\nMusic is emotion translated into sound — joy, grief, nostalgia, calm — captured in frequencies we somehow understand without words. It’s one of the few things that can make us feel seen without ever speaking back.\nBut what happens when a machine starts listening? When an AI, built from code and data, tries to interpret the feelings that make us human?\nWe often use music to express emotions we can’t name. I wanted to see if an AI could do the same. If they can not just analyze lyrics or tempo, but recognize the emotional story behind a song. Can it tell the difference between heartbreak and hope? Can it translate what we hear into something it can feel?\nTo find out, I ran three small experiments: I gave an AI my playlists, my moods, and my questions about emotion — and asked it to listen."

    "text": "Experiment 1: Emotional Mirror\nGoal: See if Gemini can read emotional patterns in my music.\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nHere’s a list of songs I’ve been listening to this week: 1. the vow ed sheeran 2. go go juice sabrina carpenter 3. primadonna marina 4. i think they call this love elliot james reay 5. last night morgan wallen 6. so easy (to fall in love) olivia dean 7. mystical magical benson boone 8. carry you home alex warren 9. can’t take my eyes off of you ms. lauryn hill 10. crazy stupid love emei\nBased on these songs, what emotional themes or moods do you think I’ve been experiencing lately? Please describe them as if you were talking to a friend — not analyzing data.\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nOkay, alright, let’s dive into your soundtrack this week!\nFirst off, it’s screaming LOVE, like, in all caps! You’ve got the really sweet, tender, “just realizing I’m falling” kind of love with “I Think They Call This Love” and “So Easy (To Fall In Love).” It sounds like that delightful, floaty, butterflies-in-your-stomach stage where everything feels light and wonderful.\nThen there’s the intense, can’t-look-away infatuation with Lauryn Hill’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You” – pure adoration! And Emei’s “Crazy Stupid Love” adds that fun, chaotic, head-over-heels energy. But it’s not just new love! “The Vow” by Ed Sheeran and “Carry You Home” feel like they’re about deep, committed, protective love. Like, “I’m here for you, forever” vibes. So, you’re experiencing the full spectrum of romance!\nAnd can we talk about the confidence radiating from this list? “Primadonna” by Marina is just pure, unadulterated diva energy, owning your fabulousness. Paired with Sabrina Carpenter’s “Go Go Juice,” which feels super sassy, energetic, and a bit playful – like you’re feeling good, maybe a little mischievous, and totally in control.\nThen “Mystical Magical” by Benson Boone? That just adds a layer of wonder, enchantment, and maybe a little bit of awe to everything. Like you’re seeing the magic in the everyday, or feeling really optimistic and dreamy about life.\nThe only one that throws a slight curveball is “Last Night” by Morgan Wallen, which has that classic country reflection vibe. It could be a moment of looking back, or just appreciating a good time, or maybe a tiny bit of wistfulness mixed in with all the joy. But even that, in this context, feels more like a reflective appreciation than anything heavy.\nOverall, it really sounds like you’re riding a wave of really positive emotions! A whole lot of love – new, deep, and all-consuming – mixed with a strong sense of self, some playful confidence, and a touch of dreamy optimism. Sounds like a pretty great week, honestly! Are you, like, in love right now?! Or just really feeling all the good feels?\n\n\n\nReflection:\nWhat surprised me most was not Gemini’s accuracy but its warmth. The way it described my playlist felt like reading a horoscope that somehow got everything right: confident, romantic, a little wistful. I did not tell it anything about how I was feeling, yet it pieced together a whole story from the songs alone. It was playful, teasing even, but also strangely perceptive.\nI am not in love right now, but I seem to be drawn to love songs. Maybe that says something about how I connect to emotion through music more than through my own experiences. “Last Night” is actually one of my favorite songs, but Gemini read it as a curveball, as if it did not belong with the rest. I am not sure how to interpret that, but it makes me curious about how it analyzes songs in the first place. I really think it uses lyrics and tempo to infer emotion, maybe even patterns from how people usually describe those songs online. Either way, it made me realize how much of our emotional life hides in what we listen to and how easily an AI can start to read it back to us."

    "text": "Experiment 2: Empathy Through Sound\nGoal: See if Gemini can learn emotional meaning through context, not just from song data.\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nI have been feeling a bit emotionally overwhelmed and just want to feel calmer and understood. Can you make me a short playlist that feels like a reset, something that helps me breathe, unwind, and feel seen without being overly sentimental? Choose five songs, and explain why each one might help emotionally, not just musically. Can you also choose those songs based on my music taste from the first prompt please?\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nHey friend, I totally get that feeling of being emotionally swamped. It’s like your brain just needs a soft landing, a little quiet corner to just be. I’ve put together a few songs that I hope can be that gentle reset for you – nothing too heavy, just a space to breathe and feel a little more grounded.\n\n\nHere’s a short playlist for you:\n\n“Holocene” by Bon Iver\n\n\n&gt; This song feels like a vast, quiet breath. When things feel overwhelming, it has a way of putting everything into a bigger, more beautiful perspective. It's about finding your place in the grand scheme, and it can make your own worries feel a little smaller, a little more manageable, just for a moment. It's like looking up at the night sky and feeling a quiet sense of awe and belonging.\n\n\n“Intro” by The xx\n\n\n&gt; This one is purely atmospheric, and that's its power. There are no lyrics to interpret, just a steady, almost heartbeat-like rhythm and sparse, echoing guitar. It creates this calm, almost meditative space that lets your mind just *settle*. It's perfect for when you need to turn down the noise and just feel a consistent, gentle presence. It's like a soft, quiet hum that helps you recenter.\n\n\n“Pink Moon” by Nick Drake\n\n\n&gt; Short, sweet, and incredibly gentle. Nick Drake's voice is like a quiet, knowing whisper here. It doesn't try to solve anything, but it acknowledges a quiet truth about the world and internal feelings without judgment. It feels like a warm, understanding nod from someone who just *gets* that sometimes things are just... what they are, and that's okay. It’s comforting in its simplicity.\n\n\n“Bloom” by The Paper Kites\n\n\n&gt; This song is pure warmth. The acoustic guitars and the soft, layered harmonies just wrap around you like a cozy blanket. It has this tender, hopeful quality that isn't pushy or overly optimistic, but just gently reassuring. It feels like a quiet promise that things can soften and grow, and it offers a sense of gentle comfort when you're feeling raw.\n\n\n“Weightless” by Marconi Union\n\n\n&gt; Okay, this one is specifically engineered to be relaxing, and it really works. It's an instrumental ambient track with no sharp edges, just flowing, soothing sounds. When your brain is buzzing, this song is like hitting the \"mute\" button on the outside world. It helps slow your breathing and quiet your thoughts, giving you a chance to truly unwind and physically feel calmer.\n\nI really hope these give you a little space to breathe and feel a bit lighter. Remember, it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, and it’s okay to take a moment just for you.\n\n\n\nReflection:\nI did not know any of the songs Gemini recommended, so I listened to each one separately before writing this. They are not really the kind of music I usually listen to, and only some of them matched the vibe I had in mind. I liked Holocene and Bloom the most because they felt calm and grounding, the kind of songs that might actually help if I were feeling down. The other three did not really do much for me. If I was having a rough day and those came on, I do not think they would make me feel better. Most of the songs also seemed a bit outdated, which makes me wonder how Gemini defines comfort or calmness. Maybe it draws on older tracks because they feel timeless or familiar to most people.\nThe goal of this experiment was to see if Gemini could provide emotional comfort through music, and in some ways it did. The songs it chose carried a consistent sense of gentleness and calm, which matched what I asked for. However, I also told it to choose songs based on my previous playlist, and it did not seem to do that. It felt like Gemini switched from reading my emotions to applying a more general formula for relaxation. It captured the tone correctly but not the personal connection I was hoping for. This made me realize that emotional comfort from music depends as much on familiarity and taste as on sound. Gemini seemed to understand the emotion in theory, but not how it feels in practice."

    "text": "Experiment 3: Teaching Gemini to Feel the Music\nGoal: See if Gemini can learn emotional meaning through context, not just from song data.\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nI want to see if you can learn how I personally connect to music. Below is a list of songs that each represent a different emotion for me. Can you analyze them and describe what you think these emotions mean to me, not just in general? Calm: coffee breath by sofia mills\nHopeful: Golden hour by JVKE\nNostalgic: Fresh Eyes by Andy Grammer\nConfident: Hotel Room Service by pitbull\nSad: a 1000 times by Hamilton Leithauser + Rostam After describing what you think each song represents for me emotionally, try to summarize what you’ve learned about how I experience feelings through music.\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nOkay, this is a fantastic way to understand your connection to music! Let’s dive into these, almost like we’re unpacking a secret language you share with these songs.\nHere’s what I’m picking up about your emotions through these choices:\n\nCalm: “coffee breath” by Sofia Mills\n\n\n&gt; For you, \"calm\" isn't about shutting down or being completely blank. This song suggests your calm is a very **intimate, soft, and almost wistful feeling**. It's not a \"zen garden\" kind of calm, but more like the quiet comfort of being truly present in a small, personal moment, perhaps with someone you care about, or just with your own thoughts. There's a gentle introspection here, a quiet settling into a familiar, tender space that feels safe and gentle, even if it carries a tiny hint of melancholy. It's a very human, lived-in calm.\n\n\nHopeful: “Golden Hour” by JVKE\n\n\n&gt; Your \"hopeful\" isn't a quiet, internal whisper. This song makes me think that for you, hope is **expansive, warm, and often tied to connection or a sense of shared beauty**. It feels bright, almost cinematic, and perhaps a little grand. It's the feeling when things align perfectly, when you're deeply connected to someone or something beautiful, and the world just *glows*. It's an uplifting, almost euphoric hope, where possibilities feel limitless and vibrant.\n\n\nNostalgic: “Fresh Eyes” by Andy Grammer\n\n\n&gt; This is really interesting for \"nostalgic\"! It tells me that for you, nostalgia isn't solely about longing for what's gone or a sad yearning for the past. Instead, your nostalgia seems to be a **positive, active re-appreciation**. It's about revisiting familiar feelings, people, or experiences and finding a renewed sense of wonder and joy in them, as if seeing them for the first time again. It's a warm, appreciative look back that brings fresh perspective and happiness, rather than just wistfulness. You find enduring value and delight in the familiar.\n\n\nConfident: “Hotel Room Service” by Pitbull\n\n\n&gt; Okay, this one screams! Your \"confident\" is clearly **energetic, outward-facing, and uninhibited**. It's not a quiet, internal self-assurance; it's a bold, almost performative feeling of owning the room, having a blast, and not caring what anyone else thinks. There's a mischievous, celebratory vibe here. Your confidence is about embracing fun, being seen, being heard, and fully stepping into a vibrant, self-assured energy that wants to make an impact and enjoy the moment to the fullest.\n\n\nSad: “a 1000 times” by Hamilton Leithauser + Rostam\n\n\n&gt; For you, \"sad\" isn't a simple feeling of being down. This song suggests your sadness is **complex, deeply reflective, and perhaps a little dramatic or theatrical in its emotional landscape**. It involves looking back, revisiting past relationships or significant emotional moments with a profound sense of longing, regret, or a heavy heart. There's an active emotional processing happening, a deep dive into the layers of feeling, perhaps agonizing over things \"a thousand times.\" It's a sadness that feels intensely personal, rich with internal narrative, and perhaps a bit raw and consuming.\n\nWhat I’ve learned about how you experience feelings through music:\nYou seem to experience emotions through music in a way that is incredibly rich, nuanced, and deeply personal. You don’t just feel an emotion; you immerse yourself in its specific texture and story.\nThere’s a strong thread of active engagement with your feelings. Whether it’s the gentle introspection of calm, the expansive glow of hope, the joyful re-appreciation of nostalgia, the bold energy of confidence, or the complex reflection of sadness – you choose songs that allow you to fully inhabit and explore the emotional landscape. You’re drawn to music that provides a specific, almost narrative backdrop for your internal world.\nYou also seem to find comfort and understanding in songs that allow for complexity within an emotion. Your “calm” has a touch of wistfulness, your “nostalgia” is positive, and your “sadness” is deeply reflective rather than just resigned. You use music to articulate the subtle shades of your feelings, finding depth and specific meaning in the sounds and stories. You connect with music that helps you truly feel what you’re feeling, in all its intricate glory.\n\n\nBonus!\nI wanted to see if Gemini could go one step further after explaining how it thought about my music. In the last experiment, it gave me songs that were meant to comfort me, but they felt more like a general version of calm rather than something personal to me.\nThis time, I wanted to test whether it could actually learn from my own songs and use that to recommend music that fits how I feel.\nI asked it to pick new songs that would create the same emotions as the ones I shared to see if it could move from recognizing feelings to recreating them and capture what feeling like me sounds like.\n\n\n\nPrompt:\n\nBased on what you’ve learned about my emotions and song choices, can you recommend new songs that create those same emotions please?\n\n\n\nResponse:\n\nOkay, this is a super cool challenge! Based on how you uniquely connect with those songs for each emotion, I’ve tried to dig up some new tracks that I think will resonate with those specific emotional textures for you. Let’s see if I got it right!\n\n\nHere are some new recommendations based on your emotional blueprint:\n\nFor that Calm that feels intimate, soft, and gently wistful:\n\n“Cherry Wine” by Hozier\n\n\n&gt; You loved the tender, personal introspection of \"coffee breath.\" \"Cherry Wine\" steps into that same intimate space, but with Hozier's raw, acoustic delivery. It feels like a quiet confession, a gentle moment shared in hushed tones. It's not a loud, demanding calm, but the soft, almost melancholic peace of being truly present with someone or a memory, finding comfort in the quiet details. It's a very human, lived-in calm, just like your Sofia Mills choice.\n\n\n\n\nFor that Hopeful feeling that’s expansive, warm, cinematic, and vibrantly connected:\n\n“Riptide” by Vance Joy\n\n\n&gt; \"Golden Hour\" gives you that bright, almost euphoric hope tied to connection. \"Riptide\" captures a similar expansive warmth and a sense of shared beauty, but with a more organic, indie-folk feel that still feels incredibly uplifting. It has that bright, open-hearted energy, like a sunny day spent with someone who makes the world glow. It's a song that makes you feel like possibilities are unfolding beautifully, full of warmth and genuine connection, without being overly polished.\n\n\n\n\nFor that Nostalgic vibe that’s about positive re-appreciation, renewed wonder, and finding joy in the familiar:\n\n“Home” by Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros\n\n\n&gt; \"Fresh Eyes\" is all about seeing the familiar with fresh joy. \"Home\" absolutely nails that feeling for you. It's a warm, joyful, almost communal celebration of enduring connection and familiar comfort. It instantly transports you to a place of belonging, where the past feels like a happy, cherished part of who you are, bringing a renewed sense of delight and wonder. It's not about longing for what's gone, but actively reveling in the enduring value of what *is* and *was*.\n\n\n\n\nFor that Confident energy that’s outward-facing, uninhibited, bold, and celebratory:\n\n“Good as Hell” by Lizzo\n\n\n&gt; Pitbull's \"Hotel Room Service\" is all about owning the room and having a blast. Lizzo's \"Good as Hell\" is the perfect complement to that, but with a powerful self-love twist. It's energetic, unapologetically bold, and completely uninhibited. It's about feeling your absolute best, celebrating yourself, and stepping out with a vibrant, self-assured energy that makes you want to dance and make an impact. It's pure, joyful swagger that says, \"I'm here, I'm fabulous, and I'm having a great time.\"\n\n\n\n\nFor that Sad feeling that’s complex, deeply reflective, raw, and consuming:\n\n“Motion Sickness” by Phoebe Bridgers\n\n\n&gt; \"a 1000 times\" gives you that dramatic, reflective sadness, rich with internal narrative. Phoebe Bridgers' \"Motion Sickness\" dives right into that complex, raw, and deeply personal emotional landscape. It's filled with longing, regret, and the active processing of a past relationship, but delivered with a poignant, almost theatrical honesty. Her voice carries a heavy heart, and the lyrics are incredibly reflective, making you feel every layer of that consuming sadness without it ever becoming simple or one-dimensional. It's a beautiful, raw exploration of pain and memory.\n\n\n\n\nI really hope these hit those specific emotional chords for you! Let me know what you think.\n\n\n\nReflection:\nThis was the first time Gemini’s response felt closer to how I actually think about music. The way it described each emotion made sense to me. Calm felt human and soft, hopeful felt bright and full, nostalgic felt warm, confident felt loud and fun, and sadness felt deep and real. It was interesting to see how well it could read those differences.\nWhen it started recommending new songs, the results felt a bit more personal than before. Some choices fit better than others, but I could tell it was trying to match my emotional patterns instead of just guessing based on genre. The calm and nostalgic ones felt most accurate, while the rest were fine but not really what I would listen to often.\nCompared to Experiment 2, this felt more thoughtful. Gemini wasn’t just picking random comforting songs anymore. It seemed to actually use what it learned from my earlier playlists. It still missed a few things, but it was closer to understanding what my version of “feeling” sounds like."

    "text": "Conclusion\nLooking back at all three experiments, I can see how each one built on the last. In the first, Gemini read my playlist like a mirror and somehow managed to describe the emotions behind it in a way that felt warm and human. In the second, it tried to comfort me through music but ended up sounding more general, as if it knew the idea of calm but not what calm feels like to me. By the third, it started getting closer. It learned from my own songs and tried to recommend new ones that matched how I experience emotions.\nWhat surprised me most was how much these small interactions made me think about how I use music in the first place. The songs we listen to really are emotional markers, tiny reflections of who we are in a certain moment. Gemini could understand some of that, but not all of it. The human part is still missing, the one that connects music to memory and meaning.\nStill, there was something special about teaching an AI to listen, not just to sound but to feeling. Even if it cannot fully understand, the process made me pay attention to how I feel, and maybe that is its own kind of understanding."

    "text": "LLM 1: ChatGPT-4o\n\nAbsolutely, I’m here for you. First, I want to say—it’s completely okay to feel overwhelmed during finals week. You’re facing a lot of pressure, and that stress is a natural response. But you’re not alone, and you’re stronger and more capable than your stress is making you feel right now. Let’s take a deep breath together before we do anything else. Ready?\nBreathe in deeply through your nose… hold it for a moment… and exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that one more time.\nInhale… hold… exhale.\nNice. Now let’s talk it through. 💬\n\n\n\nEmotional Support ❤️\nThink of everything you’ve accomplished to get to this point. Finals may feel like the peak of the mountain, but you’ve already climbed most of it. You’ve studied, learned, problem-solved, written papers, shown up when it was hard—you are resilient. Finals don’t define your worth. They aren’t a measure of your intelligence or value as a person—they’re just one part of your academic journey.\nEven if you don’t feel ready, that doesn’t mean you’re not. Anxiety often disguises itself as unpreparedness. You are more ready than your mind is telling you.\nYou don’t have to be perfect. You just have to do your best right now. And that is enough.\n\n\n\nPractical Advice 📚\nLet’s break this down into manageable steps. Burnout comes when everything feels like too much all at once. Here’s a mini plan:\n\nPrioritize\n\n\nMake a list of your exams and projects.\nRank them by urgency and importance (what’s due first? what’s worth the most?).\nRealize you don’t have to do everything at once.\n\n\nCreate a Realistic Study Schedule\n\n\nBlock out time for each subject.\nInclude short breaks every 45–60 minutes (your brain needs them!)\nGive yourself buffer time in case things take longer than expected.\n\n\nUse Active Study Techniques\n\nUse flashcards, teach concepts aloud, practice problems—don’t just reread notes.\n\n\n\nCreate quick summaries of what you’re learning and review the key points often.\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nI know it’s tempting to pull all-nighters, but your brain needs rest to function and retain information. Even 6–7 hours is better than 2–3 with extra studying.\n\n\nFood & Movement\n\n\nEat nourishing foods—fruits, nuts, complex carbs, protein.\nIf you can, get a walk in. Movement releases stress-relieving endorphins and helps clear the mind.\n\n\n\nMental Health Check 🧠\nTake a moment to ask yourself:\n\nWhen was the last time I drank water?\nHave I eaten something nourishing today?\nDo I need a 10-minute break where I do nothing school-related?\nHave I reached out and talked to anyone, even just to say “Hey, I’m feeling stressed”?\n\nYou don’t need to carry this weight alone. Talk to a friend, classmate, family member—or come right back here anytime you need support.\n\n\nQuick Stress-Calming Exercise 🌿\nTry the 5-4-3-2-1 technique (takes 1 minute):\n\n5 things you can see around you.\n4 things you can physically feel (your chair, your feet on the floor).\n3 things you can hear (background noise, breathing).\n2 things you can smell (or like the smell of).\n1 thing you can taste or are craving.\n\nThis grounds you in the present and helps reset anxiety.\n\n\n\nI believe in you. You don’t have to feel 100% confident—you just have to take one step at a time. Your effort matters, and you’re doing the best you can with the tools you have right now. That is something to be proud of.\nYou’ve got this. And I’m right here if you need encouragement, someone to vent to, or help working through specific subjects.\nWant to plan out your day right now together? Or would you like a little motivational quote? 😊"

    "text": "LLM 2: Gemini 2.5\n\nHey there. I hear you, and I want you to know that what you’re feeling is incredibly valid and completely normal. Finals week is a pressure cooker, and it’s natural for your mind and body to react with stress, anxiety, and the fear of burnout.\nTake a deep breath with me right now. Just a slow, deep inhale through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then a long, slow exhale through your mouth. Let’s do that one more time. Good.\nOkay, let’s talk this through. I’m here to support you.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Emotional Support – Acknowledging and Validating Your Feelings\n\nYou’re Not Alone: Seriously, every student I’ve ever known, including myself, has felt this exact way. This isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s a sign that you care about your success and your academic performance.\nIt’s Okay to Feel Overwhelmed: When you have a mountain of tasks, it’s natural for your brain to feel like it’s short-circuiting. Don’t fight the feeling of overwhelm immediately. Acknowledge it: “Okay, I’m feeling really stressed right now, and that’s understandable given the circumstances.”\nYour Worth Isn’t Defined by These Grades: This is crucial. While these exams are important, they are one measure of your learning at one point in time. They do not define your intelligence, your capability, or your value as a person. Remind yourself of all the hard work you’ve already put in, the knowledge you’ve gained, and the challenges you’ve overcome.\nThis is Temporary: Finals week has a beginning and an end. It feels all-consuming right now, but it will pass. You will get through it.\nBe Kind to Yourself: Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend who was in the same situation. Would you tell them to just “suck it up”? Or would you offer understanding, a listening ear, and practical help? Offer yourself that same compassion.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Practical Advice – Breaking Down the Mountain\nThe goal here is to regain a sense of control, which significantly reduces stress.\n\nThe “Brain Dump” and Prioritization:\n\n\nGet it all out: Grab a piece of paper or open a document. Write down every single thing you need to do, study, or remember for finals. Don’t filter, just dump. This gets it out of your head and onto paper, making it less overwhelming.\nCategorize & Prioritize:\n\nWhich exams are worth the most?\nWhich subjects do you struggle with most?\nWhich are due earliest?\nUse a simple A, B, C system (A = Must do, B = Should do, C = Nice to do if time).\nBreak large tasks (e.g., “Study for Chemistry”) into smaller, actionable steps (e.g., “Review Chapter 7 notes,” “Do practice problems for Chapter 8,” “Make flashcards for key formulas”).\n\n\n\nCreate a Realistic Study Schedule:\n\n\nBlock it out: Look at your prioritized list and your available time. Schedule specific blocks for specific tasks. Be realistic – don’t schedule 10 hours straight of studying.\nInclude Breaks: This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Schedule short breaks (5-10 minutes) every 45-60 minutes, and a longer break (30-60 minutes) every few hours. Use these breaks to truly step away.\nSchedule Sleep: Yes, literally put “SLEEP” in your schedule. Aim for 7-9 hours. Pulling all-nighters is counterproductive; your brain needs sleep to consolidate memories and function optimally.\nSchedule Meals and Movement: These are just as important as studying.\n\n\nEffective Study Strategies (Not Just Rereading):\n\n\nActive Recall: Instead of just rereading notes, test yourself. Close your book and try to explain a concept out loud. Use flashcards.\nPractice Problems: For subjects like math, science, or anything with problem-solving, do practice problems. Don’t just look at the solutions.\nTeach Someone Else: If you can explain a concept clearly to another person (or even a pet/stuffed animal), you likely understand it well.\nChange Your Environment: If possible, switch up your study spot. Sometimes a change of scenery can boost focus.\n\n\nSet Boundaries:\n\n\nSay “no” to non-essential commitments during this intense period.\nLimit social media and news consumption. They can be huge time-sinks and sources of additional anxiety.\nHave a “stop time” for studying each day. Give yourself permission to end your day and relax.\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Calming Down and Preventing Burnout – Nurturing Yourself\nThis is where we actively combat the stress and fear of burning out.\n\nDeep Breathing Exercises (Again!):\n\n\n4-7-8 Breathing: Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold your breath for 7 counts, exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 counts. Repeat 3-5 times. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which calms your body.\nBox Breathing: Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat.\n\n\nGrounding Techniques: When your mind is racing, bring yourself back to the present moment.\n\n\n5-4-3-2-1 Method:\n\nName 5 things you can see.\nName 4 things you can feel (e.g., your clothes on your skin, the chair beneath you).\nName 3 things you can hear.\nName 2 things you can smell.\nName 1 thing you can taste.\n\nFocus on an Object: Pick an object nearby and describe it in detail in your mind: its color, texture, shape, how light reflects off it.\n\n\nMindful Movement:\n\n\nStretch: Gently stretch your neck, shoulders, back, and legs. Releasing physical tension can help release mental tension.\nWalk: A short, brisk walk outside (even 10-15 minutes) can do wonders. Focus on your steps, the air, the sounds around you. It’s a break for your brain and a boost for your body.\n\n\nNourish Your Body:\n\n\nEat Regular, Healthy Meals: Avoid excessive caffeine and sugary snacks that lead to energy crashes. Focus on whole foods that sustain your energy.\nStay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can exacerbate fatigue and brain fog.\n\n\nListen to Calming Music or Nature Sounds: Sometimes, putting on some instrumental music, lo-fi beats, or sounds of rain/ocean waves can create a more peaceful study environment and reduce internal noise.\nAllow for “Unproductive” Time: It feels counterintuitive during finals, but allowing yourself a short period each day to do something purely for enjoyment (listening to a favorite song, looking at a funny meme, talking to a loved one) can recharge your mental batteries and prevent that deep, draining burnout.\n\n\n\n\nRemember this: You are capable. You are resilient. You have prepared for this, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Take it one hour, one task, one breath at a time.\nI’m here for you. You can absolutely get through this. You’ve got this."

    "text": "LLM 3: anthropic/claude-4.0\n\nI hear you - finals week is genuinely tough, and the stress you’re feeling is completely valid. Let’s take a breath together and work through this.\n\n\nFirst, let me acknowledge what you’re dealing with. Finals compress weeks of material into high-stakes exams, often multiple ones clustered together. Your brain is probably telling you that everything rides on this, which amps up the pressure even more. But here’s something important to remember: you’ve made it to finals week, which means you’ve already done most of the work. This is the final push, not the entire journey.\n\n\nLet’s talk about what’s happening in your body right now. When we’re stressed, our nervous system gets activated - your heart might race, your thoughts might spiral, you might feel jittery or exhausted or both. This is your body trying to protect you, but it’s overreacting. Try this with me: breathe in slowly for four counts, hold for four, out for six. That longer exhale signals safety to your nervous system. Do this a few times whenever you feel panic rising.\n\n\nNow, practically speaking, what do you actually need to get through this week? Not perfection - just getting through. Look at your exam schedule and be brutally honest: which exams need the most attention, and where are you already solid enough? You don’t need to know everything perfectly. You need to know enough to pass or to get a reasonable grade. That distinction matters because it helps you prioritize.\n\n\nBreak your remaining time into chunks. Study for 25-50 minutes, then take a real break - move your body, step outside, eat something. Your brain doesn’t absorb information well when it’s exhausted. Sleep matters more than cramming through the night. A rested brain that knows 80% of the material will outperform an exhausted brain that tried to cram 100%.\n\n\nWhat’s one exam you’re most worried about? What specifically feels overwhelming about it?"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nComparing three LLMs side by side for the same “therapist” prompt during finals week showed how differently each one approaches empathy, structure, and tone. Even though they all aimed to offer comfort and guidance, their personalities came through in very distinct ways, revealing the range of how “support” can sound when it comes from a machine.\nChatGPT-4o gave the most generic response. It focused on time management, study techniques, and self-care tips, which were useful but felt impersonal. The advice was practical, but it didn’t seem like it was really listening. The tone reminded me of reading a study blog rather than talking to someone who understood what I was going through.\nGemini 2.5 felt more human than ChatGPT. It began with breathing exercises, offered emotional validation, and reminded me that stress is temporary. The way it organized its advice into clear sections made it easy to follow and comforting to read. Still, parts of it felt a little rehearsed, as if it were trying to sound empathetic rather than truly connecting.\nThe model I resonated with most was Claude 4.0. It took a conversational and adaptive approach, asking follow-up questions about what I was most worried about and why. That made the exchange feel much more alive and personal. Claude also explained the physical side of stress, describing how the nervous system reacts and connecting that explanation to calming techniques. It struck a thoughtful balance between emotion and reasoning that felt the most genuine out of the three.\nAfter trying all three, their strengths became clear. ChatGPT emphasized structure and clarity, Gemini focused on warmth and reassurance, and Claude emphasized genuine engagement and connection. Claude stood out the most because it felt like a true collaborator. It didn’t just offer comfort; it listened and responded in a way that felt personal and intentional.\nWhat also stood out to me was how differently people find comfort. Some might need warmth, others might prefer structure, and some might find the most relief in logical reasoning. Based on these differences, I think choosing the right LLM could actually matter a lot, especially for someone seeking quick emotional support or looking for an affordable alternative to therapy. Finding the one that aligns with your comfort style could make a real difference in how supported you feel.\nOverall, this experiment made me rethink what makes an AI seem empathetic. It’s not just about kind words or advice, but about responsiveness, curiosity, and the ability to adapt. The most meaningful interactions happened when the model adjusted to me instead of simply delivering a script."
